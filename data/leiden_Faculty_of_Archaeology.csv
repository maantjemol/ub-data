He proposes a new (sub-) discipline: philosophy of prehistory. However, much research along these lines has already been conducted, not least from the phenomenological perspective Van Mazijk recommends, both by philosophers and archaeologists. This research can stimulate a philosophy of early hominin lifeworlds, intentionality and agency, which thus does not have to start from scratch."
4175358,Diverse prehistoric cattle husbandry strategies in the forests of Central Europe,"Gillis, R.E.; Kendall, I.P.; Roffet-Salque, M.; Zanon, M.; Anders, A.; Arbogast, R.-M.; ... ; Evershed, R.P.                                                         2024",,Article / Letter to editor,open access,"During the sixth millennium bce, the first farmers of Central Europe rapidly expanded across a varied mosaic of forested environments. Such environments would have offered important sources of mineral-rich animal feed and shelter, prompting the question: to what extent did early farmers exploit forests to raise their herds? Here, to resolve this, we have assembled multi-regional datasets, comprising bulk and compound-specific stable isotope values from zooarchaeological remains and pottery, and conducted cross-correlation analyses within a palaeo-environmental framework. Our findings reveal a diversity of pasturing strategies for cattle employed by early farmers, with a notable emphasis on intensive utilization of forests for grazing and seasonal foddering in some regions. This experimentation with forest-based animal feeds by early farmers would have enhanced animal fertility and milk yields for human consumption, concurrently contributing to the expansion of prehistoric farming settlements and the transformation of forest ecosystems. Our study emphasizes the intricate relationship that existed between early farmers and forested landscapes, shedding light on the adaptive dynamics that shaped humans, animals and environments in the past."

The Case of Riparo l'Oscurusciuto (Southern Italy),"Carmignani, L.; Soressi, M.A.; Ronchitelli, A.; Boschin, F.                                                         2024",,Article / Letter to editor,open access,"In the Italian peninsula, the Late Middle Paleolithic exhibits significant technological diversity, featuring blades, points, and bladelets. Assemblages displaying these distinctive characteristics have, in some cases, been labeled as Musteriano evoluto or Evolved Mousterian, and they are interpreted as contributing to the technological and typological variability within the Middle Paleolithic. In this study, we report the results of a detailed technological analysis of the lithics recovered from the latest layers preserved at Riparo l’Oscurusciuto (SU1 to SU3) in southern Italy. These layers were previously attributed to the Late Mousterian based on their chronological age and a preliminary techno/typological analysis of a small number of artifacts. Our comprehensive analysis of entire assemblages reveals the presence of original technological features, including blades, bladelets, and specific production of micro-points on flake cores. Some of these technological traits are comparable to those recently described at Grotte Mandrin in south-eastern France, which have been attributed to an early phase of the Initial Upper Paleolithic and associated with one modern human tooth. The study confirms the variability of the Late Middle Paleolithic in southern Italy and emphasizes the necessity to reassess it considering recent theories on the earlier arrival ofin Europe and their potential interaction with local populations."

While its central settlements are known for their architecture, burial treasures, and written records, less is known about its agricultural communities. This study examines Mycenaean farming strategies and their societal impacts, exploring potential resource depletion in the Argive Plain area. By using an agricultural potential model, which analyses food consumption, energy needs, and land usage, the research reconstructs Mycenaean farming practices and assesses their sustainability. The resultss suggest that Mycenaean farmers practiced sustainable agriculture, adapting to challenges such as drought and crop losses. Nevertheless, the Argive Plain rural communities may have struggled to meet the additional demands of ruling elites. The study also reviews earlier estimates of the land needed to sustain one person during the Bronze Age, highlighting the overlooked importance of livestock. The inclusion of dairy and meat production in future models could significantly affect our understanding of ancient food production and environmental sustainability. Ultimately, the research provides insights into the agricultural systems and societal structures of Mycenaean society prior to the Bronze Age collapse."

Glass beads remain a notoriously understudied category of archaeological material. Side-lined and traditionally often described as ‘trinkets for women’, beads were sometimes deemed too insignificant to depict in official archaeological reports. Until quite recently, apart from typological studies that approached glass beads as a complementary method for site-dating, bead research remained a relatively unknown field of expertise. But when we consider the wide-ranging archaeological potential of beads, they are actually highly suitable for a variety of research purposes: beads are durable, portable, ubiquitous, and highly variable objects that have been found in archaeological contexts spanning all across the globe. As such, they can be important datasets for an equally wide variety of studies of past cultures."

This is mainly caused bythe difficulty of identifying archaeological bones as domestic due to the existingoverlap in sizes. A recently published osteometrical methodology is applied that suc-cessfully allows to identify domestic forms and distinguish between anatid specieswith more confidence. Four archaeological assemblages from the Zuid Holland prov-ince in the Netherlands are reanalyzed, ranging from the Roman period to the 17thcentury AD.It is determined that domestic geese were present in the Netherlands since at least160–230 AD and domestic ducks since at least 585–725 AD. The latter might alsobe present in the Roman assemblage, but the evidence is inconclusive. Domestic spe-cies constitute only a small percentage of the total consumed anatids and do not sur-pass 15%–20% in any case, which is mainly caused by the weight of wildfowling inthe Netherlands. Chickens (Gallus gallus domesticus) were therefore much more prev-alent than domestic anatids in all assemblages. Taphonomical analysis did not showsubstantial differences between wild and domestic anatids. The sample size consid-ered in this project is likely too small and biased to accurately detect any kind of evo-lution through time."

Previous ancient DNA studies of the collared lemming and common vole have revealed dynamic population histories shaped by climatic fluctuations. To investigate the extent to which species with similar adaptations share common evolutionary histories, we generated a dataset comprised the mitochondrial genomes of 139 ancient and 6 modern narrow-headed voles from several sites across Europe and northwestern Asia covering approximately the last 100 thousand years (kyr). We inferred Bayesian time-aware phylogenies using 11 radiocarbon-dated samples to calibrate the molecular clock. Divergence of the main mtDNA lineages across the three species occurred during marine isotope stages (MIS) 7 and MIS 5, suggesting a common response of species adapted to open habitat during interglacials. We identified several time-structured mtDNA lineages in European narrow-headed vole, suggesting lineage turnover. The timing of some of these turnovers was synchronous across the three species, allowing us to identify the main drivers of the Late Pleistocene dynamics of steppe- and cold-adapted species."

The Châtelperronian stone tool industry represents the first unambiguous appearance of Upper Palaeolithic technologies in this region, and is traditionally considered as representing a geographically isolated archaeological entity produced by late Neandertals. However, debate as to the makers and origin of this industry has been ever-present. In recent years, fuel has been thrown onto this discussion through (a) the demonstration that the association between Neandertal remains and Châtelperronian artefacts at the key site of Saint-Césaire could not be reliable, (b) the identification of an immaturepelvic fragment in association with Neandertal remains and Châtelperronian artefacts at the Grotte du Renne (Arcy-sur-Cure), and (c) the formulation of a disruptive hypothesis in which the Châtelperronian directly originates from the Early Upper Palaeolithic of the Levant. In conjunction with the increasing evidence for a protracted presence ofacross Europe, these observations have led to the arrival of an inflection point for the competing interpretations concerning the origin and implications of this industry. In this paper, we provide a critical review of the Châtelperronian in light of the emerging data—taking into account technological, chronological, geographic, stratigraphic, and genetic perspectives. First we provide a detailed, three-part historiography of this industry and a modern, synthetic review of Châtelperronian lithic technology. Our review reinforces the fact that the Châtelperronian is a fully Upper Palaeolithic industry with no ‘transitional’ nor Initial Upper Palaeolithic-type technological features. Subsequently, we highlight a series of prospects, problems, and uncertainties which remain to be addressed in discussions concerning the origins, maker(s), and implications of the Châtelperronian and the onset of the Upper Palaeolithic in western Europe. Finally, we propose a few potential paths forward and call for an open and critical approach towards the re-conceptualisation of the Châtelperronian in the years to come."

By reconstructing the events surrounding the deliberate deposition of bronze weapons into rivers, the study seeks to cast more light on the martial values and practices of the time. Experimental archaeology and micro-wear analysis are used to investigate the use-life of Bronze Age weaponry. A systematic experimental methodology to study the wear formation dynamics of bronze swords and spears is developed and applied.The wear formation dynamics are thoroughly studied with a focus on the relationship between the combat movement and style performed and the type of wear developed.A selection of Late Bronze Age weapons from watery depositions in the Low Countries has been found bearing marks consistent with (skilled) use in combat. The social significance of the practices and identities associated with the use of bronze weaponry is explored, suggesting that these weapons may have become prominent in Bronze Age martial discourse as a means of exhibiting qualities of risk-taking and prowess."

Migrating communities spread across Europe within two centuries, leaving lasting changes in connectivity, language, and genetics. Yet these migrating communities did not enter an empty continent. Across Europe, they encountered indigenous communities with millennia-old roots. What interactions between migrating and indigenous communities drove the changes seen in the archaeological record? This dissertation sheds new light on this question with an innovative approach to ceramics. Ceramics bear traces of production techniques which potters learned and applied to create them. The approach outlined here can quantitatively assess the amount of shared knowledge between potters from these traces by combining the chaîne opératoire method with network analysis and probability theory. This approach is applied to ceramics from migrating Corded Ware communities and indigenous Funnel Beaker West communities in the Netherlands to detect whether potters in these communities interacted and shared knowledge. The outcomes offer a unique perspective on this period and prehistoric migrations in general. Migrating and indigenous communities are shown to co-exist for several centuries at the start of the third millennium BCE with evidence for migrant potters learning repeatedly from indigenous potters and incorporating this knowledge into the production of Corded Ware vessels."

Yet, after several decades of innovation, we must ask ourselves which of these promises are actually fulfilled, and which persistent impasses are present. Today, some reflexive questions are more important than ever. In particular, when, how and why do our innovative archaeology tools fail? Do we approach our archaeological projects with a digital wand and (implicitly or explicitly) expect a magical solution? And when there is indeed a digital solution, at what expense does it come?In this volume, scholars and practitioners in the field discuss the state of the art, as well as the promises and impasses that digital approaches to archaeology entail.

The incorporation of rights already recognised in multilateral treaties on human rights, culture and biodiversity into the intellectual property system has been the demand of Indigenous Peoples in the discussion process underway in the World Intellectual Property Organisation's Intergovernmental Committee on Intellectual Property and Traditional Knowledge, Genetic Resources and Folklore since 2000. The topic is analysed from the perspective of indigenous peoples, as collective subjects of international rights, authors, inventors and improvers, with the capacity to create and innovate using technologies that are continuously improved in their collective context. The work examines the contemporary challenges of balancing the rights of indigenous peoples and the large commercial interests involved in granting exclusive intellectual property rights. The thesis analyses, from the contexts of different indigenous peoples, the suitability of existing tools in the intellectual property system to prevent the erroneous granting of intellectual property rights and to prevent the misappropriation of the elements that integrate the cultural heritage of indigenous peoples."

We present new data that contradict this view of Middle Pleistocene Lower Palaeolithic hominins: cut mark evidence demonstrating systematic exploitation of beavers, identified in the large faunal assemblage from the c. 400,000 years old hominin site Bilzingsleben, in central Germany. In combination with a prime-age dominated mortality profile, this cut mark record shows that the rich beaver assemblage resulted from repetitive human hunting activities, with a focus on young adult individuals. The Bilzingsleben beaver exploitation evidence demonstrates a greater diversity of prey choice by Middle Pleistocene hominins than commonly acknowledged, and a much deeper history of broad-spectrum subsistence than commonly assumed, already visible in prey choices 400,000 years ago."

Global malnutrition rates remain high, and tackling this problem in the context of global population growth and ecosystem declines will require con­certed effort across many sectors. Fish has been suggested as key to addressing high rates of malnu­trition in the South Pacific region, given that it is a rich source of highly bioavailable micronutrients and is common in traditional diets. Unfortunately, there are predictions that fish catch in this region may decline by more than 20% in the coming decades, threatening food and nutritional security. Women are key to breaking the cycle of malnutri­tion and play important roles in small-scale coastal fisheries in the South Pacific. This study assessed women’s dietary diversity and the importance of fresh fish to women’s diets in a rural coastal com­munity in Marovo Lagoon, Solomon Islands, over four sampling periods. We found that women’s dietary diversity in the community was low (mean MDD-W = 3.03 ± 0.06) and that fresh fish was consumed by more than 70% of the women sur­veyed in three of the four sampling periods. Our results showed some seasonal differences in dietary diversity, highlighting the importance of sampling across seasons to better capture true nutrition. We consider these results in the context of community-based fisheries management and argue for the need to improve fisheries management by including con­sideration of women’s fishing and promoting the importance of fish to human health."

However, access to such specialist approaches limits applicability. As a convenient alternative, we generated antibodies that distinguish human AMELX and AMELY. Purified antibodies demonstrated high selectivity and quantitative detection against synthetic peptides by ELISA. Using acid etches of enamel from post-medieval skeletons, antibody determinations corrected osteological uncertainties and matched parallel MS, and for Bronze Age samples where only enamel was preserved, also matched MS analyses. Toward improved throughput, automated stations were applied to analyze 19th-century teeth where sex of individuals was documented, confirming MS can be bypassed. Our immunological tools should underpin development of routine, economical, high-throughput methods for sex determination, potentially even in a field setting."

Previous zooarchaeological research has established the alimentary roles of beavers for Mesolithic societies and their importance for fur procurement. In this paper, we develop an integrated biocultural approach to human-beaver interactions, examining the position of humans and beavers in Mesolithic and Early Neolithic multispecies systems. We contextualize beaver landscape agency in hydroactive environments with human behaviour, synthesizing currently available data on mammalian assemblages, ichtyofauna and beaver-related material culture across Northern Europe. This cross-cultural, diachronic analysis reveals previously overlooked facilitations of human behaviour by beaver practices and ecological legacies. We show that long-term trajectories of human-beaver cohabitation differed between northern European regions. While in Southern Scandinavia, human-beaver intersections witnessed major re-organizations during the Mid-Holocene, beavers retained a key role for human societies across Northeastern Europe throughout much of the Holocene and played an important part at the Mesolithic-Neolithic transition in the Dutch wetlands. Divergent pathways are also evidenced by Mesolithic beaver-related material culture, highlighting the cultural keystone status ofin higher latitude European landscapes. We argue that this keystone status is grounded in the supply of human hunting, fishing, and gathering affordances by the animals, pointing to the generative commensality between Mesolithic foragers and their beaver neighbours. Taken together, our findings demonstrate the importance of the beaver in the making of Early and Mid-Holocene forager societies in Northern Europe and illustrate the fruitfulness of deploying an integrated multispecies approach."

This difficulty limits understanding of both the past spatio-temporal distributions of whale populations and of possible early whaling activities. To overcomethis challenge, we performed zooarchaeology by mass spectrometry on an unprecedented 719archaeological and palaeontological specimens of probable whale bone from Atlantic Europeancontexts, predominantly dating fromca3500 BCE to the eighteenth century CE. The results showhigh numbers of Balaenidae (many probably North Atlantic right whale (Eubalaena  glacialis)) andgrey whale (Eschrichtius  robustus) specimens, two taxa no longer present in the eastern NorthAtlantic. This discovery matches expectations regarding the past utilization of North Atlantic rightwhales, but was unanticipated for grey whales, which have hitherto rarely been identified in theEuropean zooarchaeological record. Many of these specimens derive from contexts associated withmediaeval cultures frequently linked to whaling: the Basques, northern Spaniards, Normans,Flemish, Frisians, Anglo-Saxons and Scandinavians. This association raises the likelihood that earlywhaling impacted these taxa, contributing to their extirpation and extinction. Much lower numbersof other large cetacean taxa were identified, suggesting that what are now the most depletedwhales were once those most frequently used."

However, lab-based experiments conducted by Heyes and colleagues (Sci Rep 6: 22159, 2016) have shown that the addition of powdered MnO2 to wood turnings both reduces the temperature required for combustion by ca. 80–180 °C and significantly increases the rate of combustion. This special pyrotechnic property of powdered MnO2 may have been observed and leveraged by Neandertals to aid in fire making—a technology known to Neandertals in this region by at least 50,000 years ago. To test this idea, a series of actualistic fire-making experiments were performed to determine the practical applicability of MnO2 as a tinder-enhancing additive. The flint-and-pyrite percussive fire-making method was employed to produce sparks that were directed onto eight different types of tinder common to temperate Northwest Europe to determine if and to what degree the addition of MnO2 powder improved their ability to capture sparks that then propagate into glowing embers. The results show that MnO2 does indeed considerably improve the ignition efficiency of tinder material over untreated tinder, both in terms of the point of first ignition and the total number of ignitions achieved. It was observed, however, that the incidental addition of pyrite dust onto a tinder over the course of an experiment also appeared to improve its ability to capture sparks. Supplemental experiments using tinder pre-mixed with powdered pyrite confirmed this hypothesis, suggesting pyrite powder similarly expedites fire production. While this finding may raise questions regarding the need for collecting MnO2 for this purpose, its potential utility may lie in (1) its relative softness compared to pyrite, making it much easier to grind or scrape into powder, and (2) the greater potential for MnO2-bearing deposits to yield larger quantities of usable raw material compared to pyrite-bearing outcrops, making it relatively more abundant in some areas. Thus, when available, it is clear that adding MnO2 to tinder would have noticeably reduced the time and energy required to produce fire, making it a potentially novel Neandertal innovation complementary to the fire-making process."

Quartz-based optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dating of the sediments associated with the kiln remains has been suggested as a viable alternative. Owing to the lack of reliable and sufficiently precise independent age information, however, it remains to be established whether OSL dating can yield accurate ages for post-1650 CE features. This is explicitly investigated in this study by applying a commonly adopted quartz OSL methodology to three relic charcoal kilns which are known to have been constructed and operated between December 1941 and March/April 1942 CE.We first document the quartz luminescence characteristics and show through procedural tests that the adopted single-aliquot regenerative dose procedure should be appropriate for equivalent dose determination. Four samples collected from the uppermost part of the charcoal-rich layers in the three features yield the youngest optical ages and are considered coeval. Their average age is 1928 ± 13 CE (95% probability), which matches the independent age reasonably well. The precision associated with the individual OSL ages ranges between 7 and 14% (1 sigma total uncertainty) and it might ideally be possible to establish relative chronologies with a higher time resolution. Finally, we briefly discuss our entire set of OSL ages in relation to future strategies for sampling charcoal kilns remains. In general, we conclude that OSL dating can be particularly advantageous to help resolving chronometric issues that pertain to post-1650 CE relic charcoal kilns."

In the Netherlands, historical records generally concur that: (I) tobacco rose in popularity among all socioeconomic classes between 1590 and 1630 CE; and (II) it spread throughout the Country as a male habit. However, the presence and consumption of tobacco have exhibited profound variations across diverse societies throughout history, manifesting dissimilar patterns of employment and significance over varying temporal and spatial dimensions. By analysing a sample of 351 human skeletons dating from 1300 to 1829 CE, the present study challenges the limited historical narratives presented above and emphasizes the diverse contextual factors that influenced tobacco’s prevalence in two different Dutch centres. Our results suggest that in certain areas of the Netherlands tobacco was likely present and widely consumed well before 1630 CE, while also highlighting overall substantial female participation in the practice. Furthermore, our analysis hints at the possibility of divergent methods of tobacco consumption between sexes, suggesting that the historical narrative of tobacco as solely a male habit may warrant reconsideration. Overall, our study contributes to a deeper understanding of the complex history of tobacco in the Netherlands, shedding light on historical trends and cultural practices."

We know that these problems exist and that they limit our interpretations of past activities. What we need to do is approach these problems at a fundamental level.

Combining our results with zooarchaeological data, we conclude that the metapodium technique was only practiced on sites where deer was hunted, and deer bones were thus available. When deer were not, or barely, hunted, bone-working was limited to ad hoc tool production. Widely available cattle metapodia, which could provide a substitute for deer metapodia, especially for the production of chisels, were generally not used to make tools using the metapodium technique. Culturally determined preferences, for the use of specific raw materials, thus determined technological choices made by the inhabitants of these sites."

The detection of plant-derived residues such as alkaloids and their metabolites in dental calculus provides direct evidence of consumption by individuals within a population. We conducted a study on 41 individuals from Middenbeemster, a 19th century rural  Dutch archaeological site. Skeletal and dental analysis was performed to explore potential relationships between pathological lesions and presence of alkaloids. Dental calculus was analysed using ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem  mass spectrometry (UHPLC-ESI-MS/MS). We were able to detect nicotine, cotinine, caffeine, theophylline, and salicylic acid, suggesting the consumption of tea and coffee and smoking of tobacco on an individual scale, which is also confirmed by historic documentation and identification of pipe notches in the dentition. Nicotine and/or cotinine was present in 56% of individuals with at least one visible pipe notch. There is some influence of skeletal preservation on the detection of alkaloids, with higher quantities of compounds extracted from well-preserved individuals, and we observe a positive relationship between weight of the calculus sample and quantity of detected compounds, as well as between chronic maxillary sinusitis and the presence of multiple alkaloids. There are many limitations that will need to be addressed going forward with this type of analysis; we stress the need for more systematic research on the consumption of alkaloid-containing items and their subsequent concentration and preservation in dental calculus, in addition to how mode of consumption may affect concentrations in the dentition. Despite the limitations, this preliminary study illustrates many benefits of using calculus to target a variety of compounds that could have been consumed as medicine or diet. This method allows us to directly address specific individuals, which can be especially useful in individuals that are not always well-documented in historic documentation, such as rural populations, and especially children and women."

People living in this time of flourishing economy benefitted enormously from it in terms of employment opportunities and working conditions, which were reportedly better than in the rest of the Low Countries. However, the rapid growth of Zeeland's urban centers likely presented increasing challenges for the population in terms of accessing essential resources, including food, clean water, and housing. In the 19th century, Zeeland's economy ultimately faced a significant downturn due to the decline in the maritime trade, leading to a substantial reduction in its urban population. Examining patterns of urbanization and economic histories that differ from the commonly studied thriving industrial contexts in bioarcheological research, as exemplified by Zeeland, is a crucial yet relatively underexplored facet in our efforts to understanding the human past. To address this gap, this study investigates the impact of urbanization on the health of Zeeland's inhabitants over time by analyzing nonspecific stress markers (i.e., cribra orbitalia, porotic hyperostosis, and linear enamel hypoplasia) and chronic maxillary sinusitis in a sample of 246 individuals from three urban sites dating from 1030 to 1800 CE. Our analysis of skeletal remains reveals significant differences in the prevalence of porotic hyperostosis, linear enamel hypoplasia, and sinusitis between the medieval and post-medieval periods. These findings suggest that de-urbanization and economic decline adversely affected the health and well-being of the populations under study, influenced by factors such as working conditions and food availability. This study provides a new perspective on bioarcheological approaches to urbanization, shedding light on the intricate realities of urbanization in Zeeland and offering important insights into its complexities."

We present new carbon and nitrogen data from carbonate tissues coupled with strontium to examine if and how childhood diet and migration status are related. We assess isotopic data from Tombos, Qurneh, Saqqara, Amara West, as well as the Scandinavian Joint Expedition's Pharaonic and C-Group samples. Our analysis suggests dietary practices were different between these samples. Tombos, Pharaonic, and C-Group all have markedly varied carbon values, which may suggest a more Nubian C4-based diet. The other samples, Qurneh, Saqqara, and Amara West, are all much more similar, which may reflect a stricter Egyptian C3-diet, or may be the effect of a small sample size. At Tombos, there does appear to be a difference between individuals who have a local strontium isotope signature and those that do not. However, this needs to be explored further as strontium should be coupled with other isotopes to confirm migration. This chapter illustrates the important contribution isotopes have made to dietary and migration studies in the Nile Valley while simultaneously highlighting the potential for future isotope analysis in the region."

However, until now, few attempts have been made to assess the inter-rater reliability of these methods. This study presents the results of the analysis of interobserver variability in the recording of bone changes related to maxillary sinusitis among three observers within three human osteoarchaeological populations. The results of Cohen's kappa coefficient tests indicated variability in agreement between different observers. The agreement on the presence/absence of maxillary sinusitis in different osteoarchaeological populations ranged from κ = 0.433 (“moderate” agreement) to κ = 0.629 (“substantial” agreement). The agreement on the type of bone change present within affected sinuses was often poor, with almost no to negative agreement for pitting (Observers 1 and 2) and remodeled spicules (Observers 1 and 3). Methodological problems that can impact consistency of results between researchers include variability in sinus preservation, duration of observer experience, the use of different endoscopic equipment, lack of clarity in the original method descriptions, and a deficit in clinical corroborations for bone changes. The results of this study highlight the need to improve standards for the recording of bone changes related to sinusitis to allow for meaningful comparisons of past maxillary sinusitis frequency rates. Further investigations of interobserver variability, incorporating a greater range of variables, are also required."

Amongst Sb minerals, only stibnite can achieve, in a controlled manner, the desired effect as a decolourizer or opacifier. Mass production of Sb-decoloured natron glass seemingly halts close to the time that Dacia is lost to the Roman empire. The use of Sb as an opacifier soon follows suit, with Sn replacing it. In this paper we investigate the possibility that the disappearance of Sb-decoloured glass production is linked to the loss of access to the mines of Dacia. Lead and re-evaluated Sb isotopic analyses show that the most likely sources of stibnite for late Roman Sb-decoloured natron glass are indeed the stibnite mines of Dacia."

The identified significant difference between these two datasets can be partially explained by the difference in the models themselves, but also by the fact that climate is not the sole factor responsible for vegetation change. Sensitivity analysis of HUMLAND showed that the intensity of anthropogenic vegetation modification mainly depended on three factors: the number of groups present, their preferences for vegetation openness around campsites, and the size of an area impacted by humans. Overall, both climate and human activities had strong impacts on vegetation openness during the study period.

The sampled table wares form part of the Hellenistic to Roman Imperial local pottery production lines. The aim of this study is to reconstruct in more detail the tableware production at the site and examine Sagalassos Red Slip Ware (SRSW) in comparison with the pre-existing Hellenistic tradition in slipped pottery. The results suggest that Hellenistic Colour Coated Ware (CCW) and Gray Ware with Black Slip (GWBS) were locally produced at the site using the same raw materials as the ones used for the subsequent mass-produced Sagalassos Red Slip Ware (SRSW), namely clays from the nearby NW parts of the valley of Çanaklı. SRSW appears thus as a continuation of the Hellenistic tradition in slipped pottery at Sagalassos, at least as far as some choices for clay raw materials are concerned. At the same time, this study provides for the first time evidence of regional production of a type of eastern sigillata that appears macroscopically similar to SRSW, while the number of identified imported wares to theof Sagalassos contributes new evidence to the discussion on the production of GWBS in the wider region of Anatolia and the origin of Eastern Sigillata A (ESA). Using the site of Sagalassos as a case-study, this research aims to demonstrate the importance of the analytical examination of pottery in aperspective in order to reconstruct ceramic traditions and better understand the local and regional sociocultural mechanisms behind them."

To keep track of it, here we applied shotgun metagenomics to the gut microbiome of the Baka, a group of forager-horticulturalists from Cameroon, who combine hunting and gathering with growing a few crops and working for neighboring Bantu-speaking farmers. We analyzed the gut microbiome of individuals with different access to and use of wild plant and processed foods, to explore the variation of their gut microbiome along the cline from hunter-gatherer to agricultural subsistence patterns. We found that 26 species-level genome bins from our cohort were pivotal for the degradation of the wild plant food substrates. These microbes include Old Friend species and are encoded for genes that are no longer present in industrialized gut microbiome. Our results highlight the potential relevance of these genes to human biology and health, in relation to lifestyle."

The ceramic assemblage from El Frances, Dominican Republic, is analyzed and compared with five other sites from Puerto Rico (Hacienda Grande, Tecla, La Gallera, Dorado-42, Sorcé). Petrographic analysis clarifies the origin of raw materials and the preparation of the clay body. Results show an initial phase (ca. 350–900 CE) of Saladoid ceramics at El Frances that appears to be similar to the Puerto Rican sites in the processing and the origin of some of the raw clay materials. Between ca. 900 and 1200 CE, evidence from El Frances shows technological change, suggesting a process of socio-cultural transformation. This change entailed the production of very coarse and heterogenous ceramic bodies and the use of locally accessible clays originating from metamorphic parent rocks. The heterogeneous paste preparation is comparable with other contemporaneous sites such as El Flaco and La Luperona, located in the central north, and El Cabo on the east coast of Hispaniola. This study adds insights to manufacturing practices in ceramic production across a long-term period and shows evidence of the occurrence of similar “ways of doing” between distant communities across Puerto Rico and Hispaniola."

It has been suggested that, potentially, some of these implements were used to scrape fatty hides with mineral additives. Therefore, a series of experiments were set up to better understand the use-wear traces resulting from scraping fatty hides with mineral additives.For these experiments two skins of common seals () were scraped using either sand or clay. The use-wear traces on the scrapers were well developed and easy to distinguish. The ‘dry hide’ scrapers from the Vlaardingen Culture site Hekelingen III were reanalysed. It was suggested that the use-wear traces on these scrapers might be related to the scraping of fatty hides with additives. We concluded that the wear-traces on these scrapers did not match the experimentally observed traces. They most closely resemble traces resulting from the softening of dry hides. In one instance the traces resembled those of previously conducted dehairing experiments. Although the traces from these experiments could not be matched to those found on Vlaardingen Culture scrapers, the traces resembled those found on a retouched blade from the Middle Neolithic site of Schipluiden (3600-3400 BC). We concluded that the traces resulting from scraping fatty hides with mineral additives are distinctive enough to be recognised archaeologically. Nevertheless, the experiments should be extended to terrestrial animals with fatty hides, to fully understand the variation in traces resulting from the scraping of fatty hides with mineral additives."

The results offer fresh insights into prehistoric combat dynamics and the relationship between combat style, contact material, and the formation of wear traces. A comprehensive account of the morphology and formation dynamics of the damage inflicted on weapons, skin, and bone is provided, supported by detailed photographic documentation.The experimental design permitted to assess the frequency and type of collisions that would occur in actual spear combat. Furthermore, the development and modification of wear traces over time was also observed for the first time on spear points. The tests provided further insights into the level of training and skill required to execute specific movements with different combat objectives. Potential indicators for spear use in various combat contexts, such as fighting against multiple opponents versus more controlled encounters like duels, have been identified. The wear traces produced experimentally find convincing comparisons in the archaeological record.In conclusion, the results contribute to a more detailed understanding of Bronze Age armed encounters and provide robust guidance for interpreting combat marks on archaeological copper alloy weapons and on bones."

In bioarchaeology, sinusitis is often diagnosed through the identification of bone alterations within the maxillary sinus cavities by macroscopic and/or endoscopic examination. However, due to the inaccessible nature of frontal sinuses, CFS specifically has not been studied extensively archaeologically yet. This paper aims to demonstrate the effectiveness of diagnosing CFS through computed tomography (CT), highlighting the potential of radiographical imaging for future advancements in paleopathological research.We conducted a CT examination of 41 crania from the rural community of Middenbeemster, the Netherlands (AD 1829–1866) to assess the presence of CFS. Criteria for identifying CFS included bone formation and/or thickening of the sinus walls. Our analysis revealed that 14 individuals (34.1%) exhibited signs of CFS in one or both frontal sinuses. We found that males exhibited a slightly higher CFS prevalence (38%) than females (32%), although no significant correlation between sex and sinusitis occurrence was found. This lack of correlation suggests equal exposure to risk factors (e.g., indoor air quality, environmental pollution, allergens, and cold weather) among both sexes.To our knowledge, this study is the first of its kind to confirm the presence of CFS through CT scanning in an archaeological skeletal collection. It demonstrates that computed tomography allows for a straightforward and non-destructive detection of sinusitis in archaeological assemblages. Considering the currently limited bioarchaeological research on frontal sinusitis, our findings should be considered relevant and promising for future osteoarcheological studies on upper respiratory diseases."

High‐status and low‐status groups likely had very different nutrition and stress experiences, which might result in differences in population's body mass. Since inequality between social statuses prevailed in Europe in the post‐Medieval period, did these differences result in body mass variations between high‐status and low‐status populations in the Netherlands? In order to answer this question, this research compared body size of two post‐Medieval urban skeletal collections with different social statuses from the Eusebius cemetery of two cemeteries of the 17th–19th centuries: the Arnhem and the Broerenkerk church of Zwolle, the Netherlands. Social statuses of the two collections are estimated based on the burial locations, grave goods, and historical records. Body mass was estimated using both femoral head diameter method and stature/bi‐iliac breadth method. Results have shown no statistically significant differences in body mass between the two samples. Therefore, this research suggests that inequality in post‐Medieval Dutch society did not result in observable population body mass differences in the skeletal collections of different social status groups. It cannot, however, prove that social inequality in populations did not impact body size or health more broadly."

I examine macroscopic linear enamel hypoplasia (LEH) and maximum femoral length (MFL) as indicators of early life stress events and compare these data to age-at-death. The two populations under study are high status Zwolle (1681-1828;=46; young adult=11, late young adult=6, middle adult=20, old adult=9; females=29, males=17) and low status Arnhem (1626-1829;=113; young adult=16, late young adult=25, middle adult=53, old adult=19; females=53, males=60,). Methods for sex age-at-death estimation include accepted osteological techniques (pelvic, cranial). LEH was recorded by tooth and a measurement from the cemento-enamel junction was taken for every insult.Results indicate that individuals with LEH are more likely to die young. However, the Arnhem population exhibits more frequent LEH insults per individual and insults extending throughout the lifecourse. MFL is not correlated with age-at-death in either population. Furthermore, there is no significant relationship between LEH status and MFL (=0.495, F=0.474); although, the mean MFL was greater in the non-LEH sample than the LEH sample in both Arnhem and Zwolle (female  with LEH=423; female  without LEH=427; male  with LEH=457; male  without LEH=463). These results suggest survival of multiple physiological insults in the Arnhem population; however, this did not provide an advantage to increased longevity compared to other adult cohorts. MFL may not correlate with age-at-death or LEH status because of catch-up growth, selective mortality, or heterogeneity in frailty."

Prior studies have employed enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) methodologies; however, there are inherent limitations to ELISA-based analyses of ancient hormones. In this presentation we discuss these limitations, but also present recent results using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The high sensitivity and selectivity of LC-MS/MS has the ability to produce data that are more accurate and reliable, although costly. Here we present new paleohormone data from the Netherlands (post-medieval period,. 1600-1850), illustrating LC-MS/MS capability. Initial testing of human bone suggests progesterone, testosterone, and estradiol can be quantified using LC-MS/MS within acceptable ranges of precision and accuracy. However, cortisol could not be reliably detected. We propose a new method for paleohormone analysis of human bone, moving beyond previous studies of archaeological hair and dentine. These findings have the potential to revolutionize the study of paleohormones in the past, given that LC-MS/MS is arguably more reliable than former ELISA-based analyses and present an opportunity for a lifecourse approach. Furthermore, the examination of additional hormones beyond cortisol could have profound impacts on what we know about the past."

In fact, his contact with museums worldwide and the systematic way in which he collected and sold his materials can be characterized as a form of wholesale collecting that rested upon the creation of chains of supply and demand typical of a market economy. In this article, we explore the ways in which Malkin engaged with Indigenous peoples, intermediaries, and museums in South America, North America and in Europe in order to create this network of “producers” or “suppliers”, on the one hand, and potential buyers on the other. We do so by presenting information about the scope and breadth of his Indigenous collections, and then investigating his modus operandi. We conclude that the successful spreading of his collections in various museums and the constant pres-ence in exhibitions of objects from collections formed by Malkin shaped, in a significant way, the face of Lowland South America in ethno-graphic museums of the Global North."

With evidence for a remarkable focus on adult males and on their extended utilization, the data from this location are thus far without parallel in the archaeological record. Given their relevance for our knowledge of the Neanderthal niche, we investigated whether the Neumark- Nord subsistence practices were more than a local phenomenon, possibly determined by local characteristics. Analyzing elephant remains from two other Last Interglacial archaeological sites on the North European plain, Gröbern and Taubach, we identified in both assemblages similar butchering patterns as at Neumark-Nord, demonstrating that extended elephant exploitation was a widespread Neanderthal practice during the (early part of the) Last Interglacial. The substantial efforts needed to process these animals, weighing up to 13 metric tons, and the large amounts of food generated suggest that Neanderthals either had ways of storing vast amounts of meat and fat and/or temporarily aggregated in larger groups than com-monly acknowledged. The data do not allow us to rule out one of the two explanations, and furthermore both factors, short- term larger group sizes as well as some form of food preservation, may have played a role. What the data do show is that exploitation of large straight-tusked elephants was a widespread and recurring phenomenon amongst Last  Interglacial Neanderthals on the North European plain."

In tandem, the companion tool 'AMDirT' was developed to facilitate automated metadata curation and data validation, as well as rapid data filtering and downloading. Results: AncientMetagenomeDir was extended to include standardised metadata of over 5000 ancient metagenomic libraries. The companion tool 'AMDirT' provides both graphical- and command-line interface based access to such metadata for users from a wide range of computational backgrounds. We also report on errors with metadata reporting that appear to commonly occur during data upload and provide suggestions on how to improve the quality of data sharing by the community.Conclusions: Together, both standardised metadata and tooling will help towards easier incorporation and reuse of public ancient metagenomic datasets into future analyses."

Our archaeozoological study of the largestassemblage known, excavated from 125,000-year-old lake deposits in Germany, shows that hunting of elephants weighing up to 13 metric tons was part of the cultural repertoire of Last Interglacial Neanderthals there, over >2000 years, many dozens of generations. The intensity and nutritional yields of these well-documented butchering activities, combined with previously reported data from this Neumark-Nord site complex, suggest that Neanderthals were less mobile and operated within social units substantially larger than commonly envisaged."

Using entheseal changes in the upper and lower limbs and non-parametric tests, we have observed changes in behavior patterns between the fifth and second millennia BCE in the Nile Valley. These transformations include an increased impact on the evolution of physical activity and possibly specialized occupations in the Old Kingdom. In this regard, we discovered differences in activity based on the type of burial and the tasks performed by females compared with males. Furthermore, we found additional evidence to support the hypothesis that the Nubian state of Kerma was based on a highly mobile pastoral way of life."

Archaeozoological remains were collected during excavations in 1968–1971 and in 2003–2004, but some of the material was not studied, and a thorough synthesis was still missing. Because of this, certain aspects within this Roman settlement remain poorly analysed.With a thorough analysis of the archaeozoological remains from both excavations at Zwammerdam, integrated with contextual and chronological data, this study brings forward new archaeozoological information for this Roman settlement. The new data not only make it possible to compare animal exploitation in thewith that of the fort, but it also provides an opportunity to analyse these patterns throughout time both locally and regionally. While limited to a small area in the Roman Empire, the data from Zwammerdam can provide a further step for new, broader archaeozoological research towards the role of animals in the Roman culture and economy."

Researchers have gathered valuable information regarding these features’ functionality and construction processes through large-scale excavations in archaeological sites with anthropogenic mounds, paleoenvironmental studies and remote sensing analyses. These anthropogenic mounds represent a long-term process of formation and were used for a variety of purposes ranging from agricultural to ritual activities. While excavations and small-scale remote sensing can provide a myriad of data to improve our understanding of these archaeological sites, a regional perspective is needed to map the relationship among archaeological sites with and without terrain modifications, to better understand the Indigenous cultural patterns in their regional environment. In this regard, the primary objective of this paper is to explore to what extent these archaeological sites were related to the environment and each other. This was achieved by correlating archaeological data with a set of archaeologically recognized important environmental variables using advanced spatial statistics. The results provide important insights to understand the underlying pattern of archaeological sites in this region and its relationship with the environmental setting."

We studied this area to test earlier theories on the development of podzols in such aeolian sands, the occurrence of sand drifting, and the contemporary vegetation development, and to gain insight into the early human impacts on these fragile ecosystems. Based on OSL and radiocarbon datings, palaeoecological studies, and soil chemical analyses, the age and origin of the drift sand phases and palaeosols were established. Sand drifting started around 6000 BCE (Late Mesolithic), the drift sand covering a distinct podzol in the Younger Cover Sand II. A second Late Mesolithic drift sand phase dated from ca. 4900–4500 BCE. Three later drift sand phases were distinguished of which the last is the classic Late Medieval (and younger) phase, while the first two date from the Neolithic. All intercalated palaeosols exhibited more or less prominent podzolisation. The palaeocological data showed that, prior to the Neolithic, in the forest open patches had developed with nonarboreal vegetation, dominated by Poaceae and Ericaceae. This changed during the Neolithic, most probably linked to the introduction of crop farming, the vegetation gradually acquiring the characteristics of the classic heathland with patches of trees/shrubs. The early sand drifting, podzolisation and opening of the forest are attributed to Mesolithic land use, with intentional burning as major factor. We conclude that the local destruction of the deciduous forests by fire and associated creation of open patches with bare sand were essential for the early sand drifting and podzolisation to occur. The results shed new light on the origin of drift sands, heathlands, and podzols in the Netherlands, and on the environmental impacts of Mesolithic people, and testify to the fundamental instability of these dry inland dune ecosystems."

Here, the dominant opinion is that of a gradual and earlier start of animal husbandry and cereal cultivation, albeit of a limited economic importance. This contribution will question the Dutch dataset and discuss new data on the use of ceramics and the date and scale of the start of animal husbandry and cereal cultivation. We conclude that the transition to farming (cereal cultivation and animal husbandry) occurred around 4200 BCE, predating the transition to farming in the UK and southern Scandinavia."

Using an experimental approach, we tried to better understand the importance of recycling of these objects. For the experiments we reconstructed four so-called Buren axes. The experiments provided insights into the usefulness of broken axes as flake cores. It was also demonstrated that flakes struck from axes generally do not have a remnant of a polished surface, indicating that the importance of broken axes as flake cores has so far been underestimated. Furthermore, it was concluded that micro-debitage can successfully be studied to identify areas where broken axes were flaked."

Archaeological sites with evidence of bear exploitation from the Lower Paleolithic are rare, with only Boxgrove (United Kingdom) and Bilzingsleben (Germany) yielding cutmarked bear bones indicating skinning. We interpret these finds as evidence for bear hunting and primary access since bear skins are best extracted shortly after the animal's death. The very thin cutmarks found on the Schoningen specimens indicate delicate butchering and show similarities in butchery € patterns to bears from other Paleolithic sites. The Eurasian Lower Paleolithic record does not show any evidence for the exploitation of bear meat; only Middle Paleolithic sites, such as Biache-Saint-Vaast (France; ca. 175 ka) and Taubach (Germany; ca. 120 ka), yield evidence for the exploitation of both skin and meat from bear carcasses.

However, obtaining a secure interpretation requires the comprehensive taxonomic identification of faunal remains, traditionally done through visual morphological comparison. Due to high fragmentation, bone morphology is often insufficient to taxonomically identify a large proportion of faunal assemblages. Zooarchaeology by Mass Spectrometry (ZooMS) gives the opportunity to identify biological markers preserved in previously undiagnostic fragmentary or worked remains. This dissertation combines the analyses of bone surface modifications with biomolecular analyses in order to investigate the relationship between faunal composition and bone fragmentation, and to assess hominin subsistence behaviour through large-scale applications of untargeted ZooMS screenings. This study explores the synthesis and analysis of comparable data, for both the morphologically identifiable and unidentifiable portion of the same faunal assemblages, by investigating bone assemblages from European sites spanning the arrival of Homo sapiens within territories occupied by the last Neanderthals such as Fumane Cave (Italy), Bacho Kiro Cave (Bulgaria), La Ferrassie and Les Cottés (France). In addition, the recent development of non-destructive proteomic extraction techniques, notably on fragmented Palaeolithic worked bones, required a controlled sampling experiment to determine how sampling techniques such as the eraser extraction method affect ancient bone surfaces at a microscopic level. Through the combination of methods and the integration of complementary datasets, this dissertation demonstrates the potential of the inclusion of ancient protein analysis within the framework of zooarchaeological analysis at Palaeolithic sites."

It resulted in significant new findings allowing a re-evaluation of the total count of all iron cannon and anchors in the offshore reef, and inshore lagoon areas.This work, when combined with findings of the earlier ‘Roaring Forties Project’ (Paterson et al. 2019), and more recent research undertaken by the Western Australian (WA) Museum, provides convincing evidence that there is only one shipwreck on the Zeewijk site, and negates the hypothesis of two VOC shipwrecks present within the Pelsaert Group. The resulting updated corpus of high-resolution digital imagery, 3D models and site data will greatly facilitate future studies, public interpretation outputs and on-going site monitoring and management of this highly significant Dutch-Australian mutual heritage site. It is gratefully acknowledged that the field work was primarily funded by a grant from the Embassy of the Kingdom of the Netherlands (GCE-2019-03), with additional funding support provided through the WA Museum/Australian Government’s Underwater Cultural Heritage Program and Flinders University’s Maritime Archaeology Program. Transport, logistics and local knowledge to enable safe access to the Zeewijk site were provided by the Liddon family."

Materials: All previous research on the detection of malaria in human skeletal material using macroscopic and biomolecular approaches is considered.Methods: The approaches and methods used by scholars and the results they obtained are evaluated and the limitations discussed.Results: There is a link between malaria and porous lesions with significantly higher prevalence in malaria-endemic areas, however, they are not pathognomonic or specific for malaria. Malaria can be identified using biomolecular techniques, yet, to date there is no completely satisfactory method that is able to consistently diagnose the disease.Conclusions: Using macroscopic and biomolecular techniques, malaria can be investigated in past populations and the impact of the disease studied. Yet, this is not a straightforward process and the use of multiple lines of evidence is necessary to obtain the best results.Significance: The extensive discussion on ways malaria can and cannot be identified in past populations and the suggestions for new approaches provide a stepping stone for future research into this debilitating, global disease. Limitations: Malaria is a difficult disease to study archaeologically and successful identification depends on many intrinsic and extrinsic factors.Suggestions for further research: More large-scale spatial analyses of porous lesions as well as targeting different tissues or molecules for biomolecular identification may improve the archaeological understanding of malaria."

Our knowledge of the genetic relatedness and structure of ancient hunter-gatherers is however limited, owing to the scarceness and poor molecular preservation of human remains from that period. Here we analyse 356 ancient hunter-gatherer genomes, including new genomic data for 116 individuals from 14 countries in western and central Eurasia, spanning between 35,000 and 5,000 years ago. We identify a genetic ancestry profile in individuals associated with Upper Palaeolithic Gravettian assemblages from western Europe that is distinct from contemporaneous groups related to this archaeological culture in central and southern Europe, but resembles that of preceding individuals associated with the Aurignacian culture. This ancestry profile survived during the Last Glacial Maximum (25,000 to 19,000 years ago) in human populations from southwestern Europe associated with the Solutrean culture, and with the following Magdalenian culture that re-expanded northeastward after the Last Glacial Maximum. Conversely, we reveal a genetic turnover in southern Europe suggesting a local replacement of human groups around the time of the Last Glacial Maximum, accompanied by a north-to-south dispersal of populations associated with the Epigravettian culture. From at least 14,000 years ago, an ancestry related to this culture spread from the south across the rest of Europe, largely replacing the Magdalenian-associated gene pool. After a period of limited admixture that spanned the beginning of the Mesolithic, we find genetic interactions between western and eastern European hunter-gatherers, who were also characterized by marked differences in phenotypically relevant variants."

Much of its valuable collection of movable archaeological heritage (ca. 6000 items) is considered lost. Starting from 500 of the most precious objects of the museum stored in the Raqqa Central Bank and stolen from there in 2013, the pilot project Focus Raqqa created a concrete, workable database to enable identification by Syrian and international police and heritage institutions. The project made a pivotal first step towards potential reconstruction of the Raqqa Museum in the future. The Raqqa museum collection included cuneiform tablets. Some of the tablets were cast before the war to allow detailed study in Europe. Today the tablets have vanished. The pilot project Scanning for Syria safeguarded information from the lost artefacts by making high-resolution three-dimensional scans of the silicone rubber moulds and subsequently physical replicas of the original objects by 3D printing. The short life expectancy (30 years) of the moulds necessitated measures for long-term preservation. The Scanning for Syria team not only succeeded at the preservation and sharing of knowledge in the academic circle. It also told the story of Syrian culture and its people to everyone for raising more voices in the united effort to keep cultural heritage safe in a zone of conflict."

The protocol combines petrological properties (as studied on micromorphological samples), elemental composition of the specimens (as measured with p-XRF) and visual characterization by lithic analysts. We tested the protocol by applying it to a sample of piece-plotted lithics from four spits across the stratigraphic sequence. We document the intensive use of sandstone accounting for 25% of the tested sample. We also report a larger importance of hornfels and lower proportion of quartz than was reported in previous analyses (Kaplan 1990). The combination of micromorphological and p-XRF analysis of the Umhlatuzana assemblages demonstrates that with only visual inspection, the variability of raw materials used may be misinterpreted. With accurate raw material datasets, we are better equipped to answer techno-economic questions of the southern African Stone Age."

A combined strontium (87Sr/86Sr), oxygen (18OVPDB) and carbon (13CVPDB) isotope analysis informed possible childhood origins and diet, while sex-specific amelogenin enamel peptides revealed biological sex. Osteological analyses presented evidence of residual rickets, a healed trauma, dental pathological conditions, and pipe notches. The combined isotope analyses yielded results for 43 individuals which suggested a diverse range of geological origins, including at least 16% of the population being non-local. The inclusion of13CVPDB had intriguing implications for three individuals who likely did not have origins in the Cape Town region nor in Europe. Peptide analysis on the dental enamel of 25 tested individuals confirmed they were all biologically male. We suggest that isolated enamel may provide crucial information about individuals’ pathological conditions, geographical origins, diet, and biological sex. These data further demonstrated that a combined approach using multiple osteological and biochemical methods is advantageous for human remains which are poorly preserved and can contextualise a site with little direct evidence."

The high fragmentation of Late Pleistocene faunal assemblages often prevents proper taxonomic identifcation based on bone morphology. It has been assumed that the morphologically unidentifable component of the faunal assemblage would refect the taxonomic abundances of the morphologically identifed portion. In this study, we analyse three faunal datasets covering the Middle to Upper Palaeolithic transition (MUPT) at Bacho Kiro Cave (Bulgaria) and Les Cottés and La Ferrassie (France) with the application of collagen type I peptide mass fngerprinting (ZooMS). Our results emphasise that the fragmented component of Palaeolithic bone assemblages can difer signifcantly from the morphologically identifable component. We obtain contrasting identifcation rates between taxa resulting in an overrepresentation of morphologically identifed reindeer (Rangifer tarandus) and an underrepresentation of aurochs/bison (Bos/Bison) and horse/European ass (Equus) at Les Cottés and La Ferrassie. Together with an increase in the relative diversity of the faunal composition, these results have implications for the interpretation of subsistence strategies during a period of possible interaction between Neanderthals and Homo sapiens in Europe. Furthermore, shifts in faunal community composition and in carnivore activity suggest a change in the interaction between humans and carnivores across the MUPT and indicate a possible diference in site use between Neanderthals and Homo sapiens. The combined use of traditional and biomolecular methods allows (zoo)archaeologists to tackle some of the methodological limits commonly faced during the morphological assessment of Palaeolithic bone assemblages."

Information from studies of seeds, charcoal, pollen, and NPP recovered from the Holocene levels of the site contribute to research questions regarding the anthropogenic transformation of the landscape. The signal of human activity in the environment can be detected through the bioarchaeological signatures of deforestation, forest management or agriculture practices. In this sense, the Cova Gran de Santa Linya is a cave deposit located in the northeast of Iberia used as an occupation site, recording mainly domestic activities during the Neolithic period. The settlement was also used as a pen during the Late Neolithic to the Early Bronze Age, preserving burnt and unburned dung layers that formed pen deposits, known as. The resolution provided by the multidisciplinary nature of this work shows how forests and fields created a mosaic landscape that provided crops, pastures, wood, and fuel and clearly reflects anthropogenic changes over time. The different methodological and analytical scales of this multidisciplinary approach, including taphonomic pollen alteration, provide a better understanding of the dynamics of the cave occupation and, from a broader perspective, the regional diversity related to the availability of plant resources."

The study combines, for the first time, separate sets of thin-sections produced over the last 50 years in order to provide a comprehensive and consolidated characterisation of technological changes in ceramic production taking place at the site during the Hallstatt phases D1 to D3. It provides significant new insights into the relation between raw material procurement and preparation, on the one hand, and changes in ceramic typology and production methods, on the other hand (i.e. the introduction of the potter's wheel). The results reveal a shift from a broad spectrum of fabrics tempered with grog, sand or crushed calcite in phase Hallstatt D1, to the increasing use of non-calcareous, grog or sand-tempered fabrics. The new wheel-turned pottery (appearing from phase Hallstatt D3) is exclusively produced using a non-calcareous clay, often tempered with fine sand, indicating a specialisation in raw material selection alongside the introduction of novel shaping techniques. Evidence of continuity between the fabrics used in phase Hallstatt D1 and the new wheel-turned pottery suggests craft specialists drew upon established technological knowledge to integrate the potter's wheel. The adoption of the potter's wheel was likely also stimulated by the increased demand for new vessels to accommodate the consumption of fermented drinks such as grape wine, fruit wine or beer."

Nevertheless, different approaches to interpret lead isotopic ratios have been proposed. In this study, three methods to couple the lead isotopic signature of archaeological artefacts to their possible mineral resources will be compared: the conventional assessment of biplots, a clustering method combined with calculating model ages (as applied by F. Albarède,, 2020,, 105194), and relative probability calculations using kernel density estimates (as proposed by De Ceuster and Degryse,, 2020,(1), 107–116). The three different approaches will be applied to a dataset of lead isotopic analyses of 99 Roman Republican silver coins previously analyzed, pointing to a primary origin of the silver in the mining regions of Spain, NW-Europe and the Aegean, but showing signs of mixing and/or recycling. The interpretations made through the different approaches are compared, indicating the strengths and weaknesses for each one. This study argues that, although the conventional biplot method gives valid visual information, it is no longer feasible due to ever growing datasets. Calculating the relative probabilitieskernel density estimation provides a more transparent and statistically correct approach that generates an overview of plausible provenance candidates per artefact. The geological perspective introduced in the cluster and model age method by F. Albarède,, 2020,, 105194 broadens the analytical spectrum with geologically informed parameters and improved visualization.

Because the biogeochemistry of bone collagen and apatite is well known, current methods rely almost exclusively on analyses of bones and teeth; however, dental calculus represents a potentially additional biological source of isotopic data from ancient skeletons. Dental calculus is a mineralized bacterial biofilm that forms on the surfaces of teeth. Sampling dental calculus does not damage the dentition and thus can be used in cases where it is not possible to perform destructive analyses of conventional mineralized tissues. Like bone and dentine, dental calculus contains both inorganic and organic components, allowing measurement of C, N, O, H, and Sr isotopes. Additionally, dental calculus forms as serial, non-remodeling laminar accretions on the tooth surface, opening up the possibility of analyzing discrete time points during the lifetime of an individual. However, as a microbial biofilm and not a human tissue, the biochemistry of dental calculus is complex, containing multiple calcium phosphate mineral phases, organic and inorganic food remains, hundreds of human and bacterial proteins, and diverse biomolecules from thousands of endogenous bacterial taxa. Isotopic investigation of dental calculus is still in its infancy, and many questions remain regarding its formation and processes of diagenesis. This chapter (1) reviews the unique advantages presented by dental calculus as a novel source of biological isotopic data, (2) critically evaluates published isotopic studies of dental calculus, and (3) explores the current challenges of dental calculus stable isotope analysis through a case study of an Ancient Puebloan Basketmaker II population from the American Southwest."

How did Iron Age people actually conceptualise or practice interaction with ancestral spirits? In this thesis the use of rectangular structures during the Iron Age is explored and the meaning of related depositions interpreted⁠. The structures fulfilled a special sociocultural position in Iron Age society, emphasised by the deliberately chosen liminal location in an increasingly structured landscape⁠."

It is the first assemblage of its kind to be analysed for Upper Nubia during this period. This research examines the selection and consumption of alloys in a colonial context, in light of earlier and contemporaneous practices and patterns in both Egypt and Nubia, to assess broader systems of resource management and metal production. Drawing on the complementary information obtained from pigment analysis, novel insights into interactions between different high-temperature crafts are obtained, particularly in terms of shared provisioning systems. From this unique perspective, pigment analysis is used for the first time to illuminate copper sources not reflected in metal assemblages, while scrap copper alloys are identified as a key colourant for Egyptian blue manufacture. The integrated application ofisotope analysis further highlights the potential for identifying links between glass, faience and Egyptian blue production systems within Egypt and for distinguishing these from other manufacturing regions such as Mesopotamia. The analysis of a tin artefact further expands our understanding of potential tin sources available during the New Kingdom and their role in shaping copper alloy compositions. Overall, this holistic approach to copper alloys and their application in other high-temperatureties together different strands of research, shaping a new understanding of New Kingdom technological practices, supply networks and material stocks circulating throughout the Nile Valley."

While diet strongly influences stool microbiome composition, the influence of diet on the oral microbiome is largely speculative. Multiple ecologically distinct surfaces in the mouth, each harbouring a unique microbial community, pose a challenge to assessing changes in the oral microbiome in the context of industrialization, as the results depend on the oral site under study. Here, we investigated whether microbial communities of dental plaque, the dense biofilm on non-shedding tooth surfaces, are distinctly different across populations with dissimilar subsistence strategies and degree of industrialized market integration. Using a metagenomic approach, we compared the dental plaque microbiomes of Baka foragers and Nzime subsistence agriculturalists in Cameroon (= 46) with the dental plaque and calculus microbiomes of highly industrialized populations in North America and Europe (= 38). We found that differences in microbial taxonomic composition between populations were minimal, with high conservation of abundant microbial taxa and no significant differences in microbial diversity related to dietary practices. Instead, we find that the major source of variation in dental plaque microbial species composition is related to tooth location and oxygen availability, which may be influenced by toothbrushing or other dental hygiene measures. Our results support that dental plaque, in contrast to the stool microbiome, maintains an inherent stability against ecological perturbations in the oral environment."

Although these resources are plentiful, it is impossible to associate artefacts to specific human individuals(1) who can be morphologically or genetically characterized, unless they are found within burials, which are rare in this time period. Thus, our ability to discern the societal roles of Pleistocene individuals based on their biological sex or genetic ancestry is limited(2-5). Here we report the development of a non-destructive method for the gradual release of DNA trapped in ancient bone and tooth artefacts. Application of the method to an Upper Palaeolithic deer tooth pendant from Denisova Cave, Russia, resulted in the recovery of ancient human and deer mitochondrial genomes, which allowed us to estimate the age of the pendant at approximately 19,000-25,000 years. Nuclear DNA analysis identifies the presumed maker or wearer of the pendant as a female individual with strong genetic affinities to a group of Ancient North Eurasian individuals who lived around the same time but were previously found only further east in Siberia. Our work redefines how cultural and genetic records can be linked in prehistoric archaeology."

He interpreted them as representing one species,(now) which he inferred to be a transitional form between apes and humans. Ever since, this interpretation has been questioned—as the skullcap looked archaic and the femur surprisingly modern. From the 1950s onward, chemical and morphological analyses rekindled the debate. Concurrently, (bio)stratigraphic arguments gained importance, raising the stakes by extrapolating the consequences of potential mixing of hominin remains to the homogeneity of the complete Trinil fossil assemblage. However, conclusive evidence on the provenance and age of the hominin fossils remains absent. New Trinil fieldwork yielded unmanned aerial vehicle imagery, digital elevation models, and stratigraphic observations that have been integrated here with an analysis of the historical excavation documentation. Using a geographic information system and sightline analysis, the position of the historical excavation pits and the hominin fossils therein were reconstructed, and the historical stratigraphy was connected to that of new sections and test pits. This study documents five strata situated at low water level at the excavation site. Cutting into a lahar breccia are two similarly oriented, but asynchronous pre-terrace fluvial channels whose highly fossiliferous infills are identified as the primary targets of the historical excavations (Bone-Bearing Channel 1, 830–773 ka; Bone-Bearing Channel 2, 560–380 ka), providing evidence for a mixed faunal assemblage and yielding most of the hominin fossils. These channels were incised by younger terrace-related fluvial channels (terminal Middle or Late Pleistocene) that directly intersect the historical excavations and the reconstructed discovery location of Femur I, thereby providing an explanation for the relatively modern morphology of this ‘bone of contention’. The paleoanthropological implications are discussed in light of the current framework of human evolution in Southeast Asia."

The region is not suited to dry farming, at least not on a reliable scale. This applies not only to the present, but also to a long stretch of the past. From c. 2300 BCE onwards, the climate was comparable, with the exception of a number of short wetter intervals. The prevailing assumption is that from the Late Bronze Age onwards the inhabitants of the Zerqa Triangle subsisted on products from irrigated land. A means to test the validity of this assumption is to measure the Δ13C value of their crops. This figure offers insight into the water availability during the growth of the plants. Barley crops from three sites in the Zerqa Triangle with dates from 1100 BCE to CE 1225 were analysed. The grain was grown during periods with dry climatic conditions. The outcome is that the barley fields were not well-watered, but were not as dry as the present-day rainfed fields in dry south-west Morocco (Styring et al., 2016) or the runoff fed fields in tributary wadis in the Negev Desert (Van Bommel et al., 2021). It might be that truly rainfed fields were cultivated in addition to irrigated fields and gardens during the successive periods. That irrigation systems existed is known (Kaptijn, 2009). An alternative is the combination of crop raising based on precipitation with some boosts from irrigation. Anyhow, the assumption that crops could only be obtained through a well-functioning irrigation system should be questioned."

The authors argue that this is a limited perspective. The chapter explores its paradigmatic role in history by focusing on ‘Greco-Roman Antiquity’ (roughly 500 BCE - 500 CE), a period characterized by rapid change and enduring innovations. The concept of anchoring - the effective integration and accommodation of the new in existing conceptual categories for relevant social groups - is introduced to the conceptual toolbox of the study of frugal innovation. With a historical perspective on what innovation entails, it becomes clear that redesigning and ‘good-enough’ solutions are what probably drives innovation and its diffusion throughout history. In fact, therefore, the alternative perspective that needs explanation is not the ‘frugal’ one, but rather the (ahistorical and typically Western) idea that innovation is about linear economic growth enabled by unlimited resources. The present turn to frugal innovation is therefore better understood as a return to frugal innovation."

Here, we address this question for the Last Interglacial period (129,000–116,000 years ago), before Homo sapiens–linked megafauna declines and anthropogenic landscape transformation. We applied the vegetation reconstruction method REVEALS to 96 Last Interglacial pollen records. We found that light woodland and open vegetation represented, on average, more than 50% cover during this period. The degree of openness was highly variable and only partially linked to climatic factors, indicating the importance of natural disturbance regimes. Our results show that the temperate forest biome was historically heterogeneous rather than uniformly dense, which is consistent with the dependency of much of contemporary European biodiversity on open vegetation and light woodland."

The geology of this coastal wetland and causes for its drainage problems received limited attention till recently. We reviewed results from recent studies, identified still existing knowledge gaps and performed additional research to fill these, to produce a full description of the Holocene history and drainage of these marshes. Massive coring data that served to map the soils and surficial geology, observations in archaeological excavations, analytical data on soil and sediment characteristics, and radiocarbon datings allowed us to distinguish several phases in this history, with a main break in the early Roman Republican period with the first systematic drainage works. Earlier, natural processes brought about by sea level rise largely controlled its drainage. Once artificial drainage started, soil subsidence became an important process, aggravating the drainage problems. The bonifica introduced mechanical drainage, temporarily masking the impacts of subsidence. We quantified the historical subsidence using DTMs and developed scenarios for the impacts of sea level rise and subsidence in 2100 and 2200, assuming that this rise will be mitigated by a coastal defence system and enhanced capacity of the mechanical drainage. Our results demonstrate the important role of soil subsidence throughout the history of this wetland and need to include subsidence in scenarios for the impacts of sea level rise."

Standardization of statistical methods decreases the degrees of freedom available to researchers and may thus be seen as a way to increase the objectivity of the analysis. Here, we argue that standardization of methods is not only impossible because statistical methods rely on assumptions that need to be considered on a case-by-case basis but also undesirable because it may block innovation. We propose that the entheseal changes field is better served by standardization of reporting and discuss how reporting guidelines may be developed based on examples from biostatistics."

There were two available options to generate LCPs in QGIS and one in ArcGIS. Different routes were produced in all three cases with the ones generated in QGIS appearing to be following the contours of the landscape and being closer to the surveyed paths. In the end the study shows that advanced spatial analyses can be conducted by employing FOSS.

The earliest indicators of human activities from the Younger Neolithic (late 5th to early 4th millennium B.C.E.) come from colluvial deposits. Our investigations, for the first time, show Middle to Late Bronze Age (ca. 1400–800 B.C.E.), permanent rural settlement in a German central upland region, with a peak in the Late Bronze Age. Due to the varying thicknesses of Bronze Age colluvial deposits, we assume land use practices to have triggered soil erosion.

The article aims to shed light on common practices and understandings between men and women, while highlighting potential differences. The analysis is based on the mapping of offending behaviours recorded by Leiden police court and Amsterdam correctional court in the second half of the nineteenth century. In part, the article confirms what other historians have already shown: women were on average accused of committing an offence closer to their home than men, but they were also very much present in the streets around their house. But the data presented also shows that women and men were more or less mobile according to the time of day, that they shared a common understanding of what their neighbourhood represented, and that work was an important reason why women would commute outside of their neighbourhood.

The five case studies that comprise this work investigate the mortality ages and morphologies of animals, and the dietary linkages between humans and several animal species commonly found in archaeological sites throughout the Greater Antilles such as domesticated dogs and possibly managed endemic rodents known as hutias. Isotopic analysis of animal remains was conducted to determine the consumption of maize as a proxy for investigating closeness in human-animal interactions. In the frame of niche construction theory, the evidence presented in this dissertation relates to the environmental practices of Indigenous peoples. Slash-and-burn farming was a widely practiced environmental management strategy throughout the region which likely created mosaiced plant communities consisting of garden plots and old-growth forest. These mixed anthropogenic and natural environments have been shown to be beneficial to some dietary generalists, and the abundance of hutias in archaeological sites might be the result of ‘garden hunting’ of species that benefited from horticultural practices. This may have constituted a form of animal management that is tied to plant food production, and therefore represents an arguably sustainable form of low-level food production."

Instead, there were supra-regionally shared ideas and conventions behind this practice.This book aims to acquire a better understanding of these ideas and conventions. By systematically investigating the objects and places that people selected for metalwork depositions, the logic behind the practice of selective metalwork deposition is unravelled.This book focuses specifically on the emergence of the practice in Denmark, northern Germany, and the Netherlands, a non-metalliferous region that has not been studied as a whole before, despite striking similarities in the archaeological record. Starting from the first introduction of metal, the emergence and development of selective metalwork depositions is examined and followed over time.

The open-air sites of Cala d’Arconte, Capo Grosso and Cala Bianca, located along the Italian south-west coastline, represent, in this context, an important source of information for the Lower Paleolithic. These sites were discovered and preliminarily studied in 1967–70 by A. Palma di Cesnola and P. Gambassini of the University of Siena, who ascribed them to the Acheulean due to the recovery of several handaxes associated with flaking reduction systems part of which attributed to the Levallois technology. A small number of the handaxes was recovered in its stratigraphic position while Levallois artefacts were collected exclusively on surface, leaving the question about the relations between these two groups unsolved. Here, the sites of Cala d’Arconte, Capo Grosso and Cala Bianca and their lithic collections are reinvestigated by re-evaluating the stratigraphy at each locality and by analyzing the techno-typology of the available artefacts. During a test trench carried out at Cala Bianca, several Levallois artefacts were discoveredin the uppermost part of the sequence in a layer located above a tephra recently attributed to the X-6 marker of the Monticchio series dated to 108.33 ± 1.08 ka. We suggest that theseLevallois artefacts belong to a Mousterian layer that must be considered as the most plausible origin for the Levallois assemblage previously collected out of context at this site. In turn, we also suggest that the Levallois and biface components collected from the surface at Cala Bianca and Capo Grosso derive from distinct occupations in time."

Because the resulting distortions may influence the quality of the interpretation of single settlements and settlement patterns, various checks of the terrain and the collected data are needed. Therefore, in current survey projects different types of tests and data filtering are increasingly implemented both in the field and in the laboratory as a part of their methodology. However, some of the most important archaeological landscape projects were initiated long before an agreement on a standard methodology for field survey was reached. As a result, legacy datasets have been deemed to be of little value to present-day scholarship due to the current research standards. In this paper, we examine if legacy data can be useful to contemporary research by performing a study comparing legacy data collected by the Forma Italiae survey project to contemporary data collected by the LERC project. The Forma Italiae survey project was carried out in the late 20th century and produced a large dataset of archaeological sites in the area around the ancient town of Venusia (located in Southern Italy). We first analyzed the relationship between surface visibility and the density of identified Hellenistic-period sites by means of a statistical analysis, and then tested the reliability of the legacy site patterns by comparing them with new data recovered from the field in a recent re-survey of this region by our team as a part of the LERC project. We thus assessed the compatibility of the clustered pattern of sites detected by the Forma Italiae and the new LERC field surveys. At odds with more pessimistic estimations, we conclude that on the regional level and coarse scale of analysis the legacy survey data is representative and offers significant evidence to current scholarship for the study of ancient settlement patterns."

This paper focuses on the manufacture of glazed pottery within the local pottery repertoire of Chalkis, while trying to contextualise the pottery typology and to consider the issues of technology. The chemical analysis by non-invasive energy dispersive X-ray fluorescence (XRF) and Scanning electron microscopy (SEM-EDS) provided information about the compositional variation of the examined glazed ceramics assemblage. Moreover, sections of the samples were examined by optical microscopy and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) in order to determine the microstructure of the samples, as well as the vitrification and the porosity of the ceramic body. Finally, X-ray diffraction (XRD) was applied for qualitative mineralogical analysis indicating presence or absence of high temperature phases and information about firing conditions."

This project studied the societies of Paracas and Nasca in the northern part of the Nasca basin in south Peru from a variety of perspectives and from the Pacific coast up to the Andean highlands. Apart from a regional settlement survey and excavations at important sites dating from all pre-hispanic periods, the study of the geoglyphs was a key part of the project. In collaboration with Armin Gruen (ETH Zurich), the geoglyphs were photogrammetrically recorded and modelled in 3D, as a basis for their archaeological documentation and analysis. This resulted in the first comprehensive database of geoglyphs of a sub-region of the Nasca basin and shed new light on the origin, development, and social and cultural significance of the geoglyph phenomenon over time."

Here we propose the following globally applicable guidelines, taking into consideration diverse contexts. These hold that: (1) researchers must ensure that all regulations were followed in the places where they work and from which the human remains derived; (2) researchers must prepare a detailed plan prior to beginning any study; (3) researchers must minimize damage to human remains; (4) researchers must ensure that data are made available following publication to allow critical re-examination of scientific findings; and (5) researchers must engage with other stakeholders from the beginning of a study and ensure respect and sensitivity to stakeholder perspectives. We commit to adhering to these guidelines and expect they will promote a high ethical standard in DNA research on human remains going forward.In this Perspective, a group representing a range of stakeholders makes the case for a set of five proposed globally applicable ethical guidelines for ancient human DNA research."

Epigravettian sites were sorted into three chronological clusters: initial LGM (ILGM) (26.5-24.0 ka), local LGM (LLGM) (24.0-20.0 ka), and post-LGM (PLGM) (20.0-14.7 ka). We obtained new radiocarbon dates from previously dated and undated sites, then analysed the lithic tool typology and faunal data to seek correlations between age and archaeological features.The lithic typology study did not find differences between ILGM and LLGM sites, but the tool type variance between LLGM and PLGM was significant, applicable for relative chronology. ILGM and LLGM lithic assemblages were characterized by domestic tool dominance and the frequent use of flake tools. PLGM assemblages were correlated with armature dominance and blade/let tools. Among the armatures, backed point variants characterized the PLGM sites compared to the ILGM and LLGM. The sole ILGM lithic armature was the retouched blade/let point. The LLGM also possessed this type and often included backed blade/lets.ILGM faunal data, although few, implied the hunting of mammoth and reindeer. The LLGM data represented recurring hunting of reindeer and horse, and PLGM data indicated the hunting of horse, reindeer, and mammoth.Our results suggested that the territory of Poland was deserted by humans in the LLGM. Moravia and Lower Austria was inhabited until the first half of the LLGM, while the Carpathian Basin was all along the ILGM. The preference for the Carpathian Basin could have been the milder climate, the abundance of fauna, and permanent access to tree vegetation. After the LGM the glacial flora and fauna gradually disappeared, leading to a reduced human presence in southern ECE. Thus, the disappearance of the Epigravettian culture and Pleistocene hunter-gatherer occupations are linked to the amelioration of climate that resulted in the disappearance of the Pleistocene environment.

Although the selection of LP and the consumption of prehistoric milk must be linked, considerable uncertainty remains concerning their spatiotemporal configuration and specific interactions,. Here we provide detailed distributions of milk exploitation across Europe over the past 9,000 years using around 7,000 pottery fat residues from more than 550 archaeological sites. European milk use was widespread from the Neolithic period onwards but varied spatially and temporally in intensity. Notably, LP selection varying with levels of prehistoric milk exploitation is no better at explaining LP allele frequency trajectories than uniform selection since the Neolithic period. In the UK Biobank,cohort of 500,000 contemporary Europeans, LP genotype was only weakly associated with milk consumption and did not show consistent associations with improved fitness or health indicators. This suggests that other reasons for the beneficial effects of LP should be considered for its rapid frequency increase. We propose that lactase non-persistent individuals consumed milk when it became available but, under conditions of famine and/or increased pathogen exposure, this was disadvantageous, driving LP selection in prehistoric Europe. Comparison of model likelihoods indicates that population fluctuations, settlement density and wild animal exploitation—proxies for these drivers—provide better explanations of LP selection than the extent of milk exploitation. These findings offer new perspectives on prehistoric milk exploitation and LP evolution."

As the Low Countries are devoid of copper ores and alloying elements, a combination of typo(chrono)logical and compositional analysis is used to identify through which European contact networks (such as Atlantic, Central European or Nordic exchange networks) these alloys were obtained. We employ a methodology that (following Bray et al., 2015) defines alloy groups by presence of As, Sb, Ag and Ni over 0.1 %wt, but expanded this classification to include Pb and to track high-impurity (>1%wt) alloys. Due to interfering soil-derived iron hydroxides, and preferent dissolution of copper from the objects’ surface, the determination of tin is in most cases overestimated when using p-XRF, so Sn was not systematically reviewed. Objects were assigned a calendar age in years BCE to facilitate chronological sorting. Using this classification, we could show how different alloys (using different base ores) were used in different periods, and in different combinations. Moreover, particular alloys were used for different groups of functional types of objects. Also, we show diachronic differences in the influx of new (or less frequently mixed) alloys and chronological trends in the substitution of As by Sn as main alloying element in the Early Bronze Age as well as the rise of leaded alloys at the close of the Bronze Age. Combining information on the composition of the objects with their typological traits, allowed us to reconstruct the scales and geographic scopes of the European contact networks in which the copper alloys used throughout later prehistory were obtained."

The high definition of the current scanners allow for even small lesions to be visualized, therefore giving osteoarchaeologists a powerful tool to investigate disease in the past.The study of chronic maxillary sinusitis (CMS) has received significant attention in the past years as the presence of CMS is generally considered indicative or air quality. We discuss here the methodological implications of using CT scans for diagnosing CMS in contrast to classical endoscopical observation. A total of 32 crania from the Dutch post-medieval rural village of Middenbeemster (AD 1829-1866) were examined both endoscopically and through CT scans. Criteria for identifying CMS included presence of bone spicules and pitting on the sinus walls. 12 cases of CMS were identified endoscopically, and 19 through CT scanning. Statistical analysis revealed no significant differences in scoring CMS endoscopically or through radiographic imaging (τb=0.246,=0.170). When investigating differences among features, no statistical difference was found between spicules observed through macroscopical analysis and computed tomography respectively (τb=0.246,=0.170). The same analysis, however, revealed a statistically significant difference in endoscopically-assessed and CT-observed pitting (τb=0.374,=0.037). Our results suggest that diagnosis of CMS on human skeletal remains can be confidently performed both through endoscopical and radiological analysis, albeit delivering better performances in scoring bone formation in contrast to bone resorption. Further research is being considered to fully explore the role of computed tomography in the study of CMS."

Tracing its origin in the early colonial accounts one finds that this denomination (as ‘sacrifice-to-the-devil’ in combination with cannibalism) was used by the Spaniards in a systematic propagandistic fasion as part of the demonisation of the Aztec and other Mesoamerican cultures with the aim of justifying the colonial invasion. Many descriptions are evidently no eye-witness testimonies but based on hearsay and imagination. In a number of cases it is even doubtful that people were killed. In other cases, the killings, though maybe caried out in a ritualised context, seem not to have been actually first and foremost ‘sacrifices’, but rather forms of death penalty, execution, political murder or other instances of (in principle secular) homicide. In order to construct this hostile image, the colonial accounts misrepresented socially sanctioned killings, confusing them with religious acts such as ancestor worship and specific funerary customs, as well as with the frequent self sacrifice (bloodletting). There is an important, though often overlooked, parallel with the contemporaneous accusations of “witchcraft” against innocent women in European societies. But where modern scholarly consensus holds that the allegations of the witch craze were unwaranted, in the case of the “human sacrifice’ contemporary studies (also our own) have often still reproduced the terminology of the colonial demonisation. After 500 years it is time for a decolonial historical critique."

Much speculation has centred around the idea that extreme climate fluctuations during Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 3 like Heinrich Stadial 4 (HS-4) were possible drivers for their disappearance. In other words, the extreme warm / cold fluctuations created an uninhabitable setting for Neanderthals, helping the dispersal of H. Sapiens intoIberia. These arguments were originally based on marine and ice core records of far-reaching origin that could provide little information at the local level. At the time this evidence was sufficient, as no other records were available. In recent years, studies have presented terrestrial palaeoclimate records from Iberia during the last glacial, but more are required to adequately understand the local response to Atlantic marine influences. Moreover, few terrestrial records are connected to known archaeological sites. The research presented in this thesis provides a more comprehensive understanding of palaeoclimate change during the Last Glacial Period and the potential implications for Neanderthal / H. sapiens movements in Iberian Peninsula. To achieve this, we examine the importance of a robust and direct U-Th chronology in conjunction with establishing local, terrestrial palaeoclimate records for the coastal Iberian Peninsula during the Holocene and Last Glacial Period."

Starch grains preserved in dental calculus and on stone tools have been recovered from archaeological material from sites around the world. However, the ability to identify archaeological starch grains relies on having a broad (i.e., many taxa) and deep (i.e., many individuals from the same taxon) reference collection from modern plants. Only a small handful of such reference collections have been published, and thus far none have been created for taxa from the Eastern Mediterranean. This region is rich in plants that have been used for their starch-rich seeds and roots since prehistory, and many of the wild taxa are the progenitors of domesticated species that were cultivated in the Neolithic and remain economically important today. To help document the history of human interactions with these plant taxa, we present here a reference collection based on the analysis of 220 individual plant parts (e.g., seeds, tubers) from 188 modern Levantine plant species (both wild and domestic), and three non-native plants that are frequently found as modern contamination. Of the examined plant samples, 110 from 106 taxa (species and subspecies) contained starches. We also provide a key based on this collection to aid in the identification of archaeological starch remains."

These studies employ a range of methods including microscopy, and DNA and protein extraction. Despite the promise of these methods little attention has been given to the potential biases associated with the accumulation of dietary compounds into dental calculus during the lifetime of an individual. Our recently-developed oral biofilm model has the potential to elucidate these biases by growing in vitro dental calculus in a controlled environment. Here we report on one validation test of the system, which explored whether our model calculus mineralizes in a manner similar to actual calculus. FTIR was conducted on multiple samples across 25 days of model calculus growth. Results show an overall increase in the inorganic component relative to organic over the course of the experiment. This is especially evident in the hydroxyapatite peak at 1040 and doublet at 605 and 565 wave-numbers (cm -1), and a reduction in intensities of the peaks at 1546 and 1654 wavenumbers (cm-1). IR splitting factors (IRSF) ranged from 2.38–3.30, indicating a similar level of crystallinity to modern human-derived calculus samples (IRSF 3.46–3.76). The final model calculus consisted mainly of carbonated hydroxyapatite, the principal component of real calculus, although with a higher organic component than the comparative modern samples. This and prior validation of the model dental calculus suggests that it is a viable method to supplement the analysis of fossil dental calculus."

One of these individuals, La Quina 5, is examined using dental microwear texture analysis (DMTA) and plant microremain analysis to reconstruct the diet. Reference samples for the DMTA include Hortus (n "" 5), Krapina (n "" 19), Malarnaud, Spy I, Vindija (n "" 4), as well as Holocene Homo sapiens having various subsistence strategies (n "" 150). For the plant microremain analysis, we compared La Quina 5 to Spy I and II, Shanidar III, La Ferrassie and a modern reference sample. La Quina 5 may have relied signi ܪcantly on hunted resources in the cold glacial interval of Heinrich Stadial 6 or 5, indicated by a low complexity value that suggests limited hard food consumption. Plant microremains, such as starch grains from grass seeds and plant underground storage organs, are evidenced in the dental calculus. These coarse and poorly processed plant foods were masticated using varied movements of the jaws compared to most other Neandertals, reflected in the low anisotropy of La Quina 5. These findings emphasize the consumption of plant foods in Neandertal diets even during Ice Age climate extremes."

However, for various reasons, existing information about ancient diets is heavily biased towards the consumption of animal foods. Plants are known to be important components of modern hunter-gather diets, and the inclusion of plant foods and the development of processing technologies have been implicated in grade shifts within the hominin lineage. Using a behavioral ecology framework, the ERC-funded HARVEST project has asked: What types of plants did hominins eat, and why did they choose the ones they did? Analyses of microremains and residues preserved in dental calculus has provided a snapshot of the kinds of foods consumed. We have furthermore developed a model dental calculus system that allows us to develop new analytical methods and address hidden biases associated with the extraction and analysis of microremains. Our studies of food preferences and energetic costs of various subsistence-related behaviors among the Baka have highlighted the interactions between cultural mores, individual preferences, and energetic constraints. Our analysis of variation in plant properties among microhabitats in African environments similar to those used by hominins has allowed us better model what nutritional qualities drive their food choices. Finally, we have assessed how the energetic costs of fire might influence food processing choices. Results from these studies have indicated that plants were an essential part of the hominin dietary repertoire throughout our evolutionary history, and that the consumption of plants is determined by environmental, caloric, cultural, and personal influences."

This study examines the social structure of post-medieval Dutch communities and their level of genetic homogeneity and inter-relatedness. The research aims were to identify probable genetic relatives within the Middenbeemster skeletal collection through developmental foot anomalies and to analyze the spatial structure of the Middenbeemster cemetery in the context of intracemetery kinship relations. Three hundred eighty individuals from four different skeletal collections were examined for the presence of fourteen non-metric traits, selected on various criteria (e.g., heritability). The Middenbeemster trait frequencies were compared with those of a reference sample of the post-medieval Dutch population (consisting of individuals from the Dutch post-medieval collections of Arnhem, Eindhoven, and Zwolle). A hypothetical kinship group could be identified when the trait frequencies of the Middenbeemster sample were considerably higher than those in the reference sample. Other sources had only limited validation value in relation to the hypothesis. Visual examination and spatial statistics of the distribution of the hypothetical kinship group revealed a possible patrilineally structured cemetery, although this is based on a small sample. By putting the observed trait frequencies in a broader context, the data suggested a rather high inter-relatedness of the Middenbeemster community. It also exposed the need for a better understanding of the used traits and perhaps a different approach to kinship analysis (due to necessarily large time investment in contrast to limited results). In conclusion, this study gave an insight into the social structure of post-medieval Dutch communities. Future improvements to kinship analysis may not only be beneficial for bioarchaeology, but also for other fields such as forensic anthropology."

Currently, the analytical techniques used to visualize the internal structure of human dental calculus and entrapped inclusions are limited and require destructive sampling, which cannot always be justified.We used propagation phase-contrast synchrotron radiation micro-computed tomography (PPC-SR-μCT) to non-destructively examine the internal organization of dental calculus, including its microstructure and entrapped inclusions, on both modern and archeological samples.The virtual histological exploration of the samples shows that PPC-SR-μCT is a powerful approach to visualize the internal organization of dental calculus. We identified several important features, including previously undetected negative imprints of enamel and dentine growth markers (perikymata and periradicular bands, respectively), the non-contiguous structure of calculus layers with multiple voids, and entrapped plant remains.PPC-SR-μCT is an effective technique to explore dental calculus structural organization, and is especially powerful for enabling the identification of inclusions. The non-destructive nature of synchrotron tomography helps protect samples for future research. However, the irregular layers and frequent voids reveal a high heterogeneity and variability within calculus, with implications for research focusing on inclusions."

The colonization strategy employed was highly variable through time, ranging from the construction of militarized fortresses (Middle Kingdom 2050–1650 BCE) to an amicable co-existence approach (New Kingdom 1550–1050 BCE). Egyptian tactics also varied spatially, depending on several factors including a colonized community's utility to the empire and the potential for revolt. Using a large dataset (= 341), this paper compares osteoarthritis between seven Nubian communities to (1) evaluate whether imperial strategy impacted osteoarthritis severity and (2) assess whether rates of osteoarthritis differed between colonized communities.Age-controlled analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) suggests there was significant variation in the frequency and severity of osteoarthritis throughout the empire. The Middle Kingdom C-Group, an indigenous Nubian population that lived outside the Egyptian-built and -occupied fortresses, displayed the highest rates of osteoarthritis for nearly all joint systems. Osteoarthritis then decreased during the postcolonial Second Intermediate Period (1650–1550 BCE) and again increased during the recolonization of the New Kingdom. However, there is significant variation of osteoarthritis at three New Kingdom sites, each of which experienced a differing colonization approach. This study suggests that the varying imperial strategies utilized by the Egyptian Empire may have impacted the physical activities and daily lives of Nubians and that these tactics were not equal throughout Nubia but were tailored to communities. It is therefore difficult to discuss a singular outcome of colonization; rather, these interpretations need to be nuanced with community-level archaeological context."

However, it is not known if this sampling strategy introduces biases into studies of the ancient oral microbiome. Here, we present the results of a shotgun metagenomic study of a dense sampling of dental calculus from four Chalcolithic individuals from the southeast Iberian peninsula (ca. 4500–5000 BP). Interindividual differences in microbial composition are found to be much larger than intraindividual differences, indicating that a single sample can indeed represent an individual in most cases. However, there are minor spatial patterns in species distribution within the oral cavity that should be taken into account when designing a study or interpreting results. Finally, we show that plant DNA identified in the samples is likely of postmortem origin, demonstrating the importance of including environmental controls or additional lines of biomolecular evidence in dietary interpretations."

These intensification efforts resulted in increased reliance on lower-ranked aquatic (fish) resources with knock-on effects for lithic technological organization. We compare data on the relative contributing of fishing to the diets of highland hunter-gatherers at Sehonghong rockshelter with a faunal proxy widely argued to correlate with subsistence intensification (faunal assemblage evenness). In addition, we compare these data with two measures of lithic technological intensification (cutting edge production and core reduction intensity) to test whether diet intensification tracks technological intensification. We show that at Sehonghong, aquatic resource exploitation is not always correlated with faunal assemblage evenness. We find that some layers (i.e. RF) show spikes in aquatic resource use irrespective of changes in mammal hunting. Other layers (i.e. layer RBL/CLBRF) were intensively occupied, but they do not have many fish. Our data also demonstrate that aquatic resource use is not associated with lithic technological intensification. These results suggest that while aquatic resource exploitation was a ‘fallback’ option for some of Lesotho's highland hunter-gatherers, there is considerable variability. Our data show that multiple intensification dimensions were variably combined through the Late Pleistocene at Sehonghong as they were elsewhere in southern Africa."

This, together with the associated material culture and zooarchaeological evidence, suggest a regionally adapted mixed agropastoral economy. The findings at Togolok 1 contribute to the ongoing discussion of dietary choices, human/landscape interactions, and the adaptation of crops to diverse ecosystems in prehistoric Central Asia."

Since very few written sources survived, archaeological research is the main source for the knowledge of Early Medieval society. Theories of deserted land after the retreat of the Romans and repopulation by Germanic mass migration were rife. During the years 2001-2010 I got the opportunity to excavate an Early Medieval burial ground with 513 graves at Broechem (B, prov. of Antwerp). For the first time in Flanders modern excavation techniques and interdisciplinary post-excavation research were applied on a Merovingian cemetery. This approach tells us more about rituals, technical features, costume traditions etc., but also provides us with information regarding the socio-economic relations and the symbolic traditions. The geographic situation of Broechem in a remote area of Northern Gaul, on a loamy sand plateau enclosed by rivers, and the presence of multi-cultural objects in the grave goods, shed light on Early Medieval society. My research explores the meaning of this cemetery in this remote region by analyzing the material culture as a reflection of social and ideological life of this community in this transition period."

Metallic antimony objects are rare, and mostly confined to Chalcolithic Central Italy and to the first millennia BCE in the southern Caucasus. The innovation of antimony use in metallurgy seems to be confined to the southern Caucasus, and the invention of it might be even more specifically situated in the Great Caucasus. Preexisting knowledge of mining set the pathway for the initial stage of antimonial copper alloys in the first half of the third millennium BCE and for metallic antimony ornaments in the second half of the third millennium BCE. However, the first major expansion of antimony in the metallurgy of the Racha-Lechkumi district in the southern Caucasus (present-day Georgia) started around 1700 BCE, while its spreading in glassmaking occurred in the Late Bronze Age (LBA). Explanations that place antimony adoption within its broader social context are favoured over those that consider material or geological properties in isolation. A recurring theme is the importance of comparative analysis, both geographically and between the different pyrotechnologies, including the precious metals and glass industries, to explore how social, political, climatic and economic conditions affected adoption and innovation patterns. All these factors are considered to explain why the extraction of antimony blossomed in the Late Bronze Age in the southern Caucasus and to reconstruct a framework of exploitation, distribution/trade and use of antimony in the Caucasus and its neighbouring regions in the south and east."

Although the energetic efficiency of masticatory effort is one of the fundamental concepts through which the functional morphology and evolution of the human masticatory system is explored, nothing is known currently about the associated metabolic costs and how this is influenced by the item being chewed. Here, using respirometry and electromyography ofwe demonstrate that chewing by human subjects represents a measurable energy sink. Chewing a tasteless odorless gum elevates metabolic rate by 10-15% above basal levels. The energy expenditure increases with gum stiffness and is paid for by greater muscle recruitment. For modern humans it is likely that mastication represents a small part of the daily energy budget. However, for our ancestors, before the onset of cooking and sophisticated food processing methods, the costs must have been relatively high, adding a novel energetic dimension to the interpretation of hominin dentofacial fossils."

This collaborative approach represents an innovation in purposive (as opposed to statistical) archaeological survey, an essential phase of research—especially in low-visibility environments—that has been neglected by literature on archaeological method. Our method centers local conceptions of place and (often fluid) boundaries, as well as history and story. We highlight the role that participatory mapping can play in the development of critical Indigenous cartographies, as well as its value in supporting Indigenous-led movements for sovereignty and long-term ecological stewardship, including gathering evidence for use in land claim cases."

This isotopic study investigates the paleodiets of several species of endemic rodents from three late precolonial sites in the northern Dominican Republic: El Flaco (cal. ad 990–1452), El Carril (cal. ad 1030–1262), and La Entrada (cal. ad 840–900) to assess whether human influence over animal diets can be determined. We examined bone collagen carbon (δ13Cco) and nitrogen (δ15N) and tooth enamel carbon (δ13Cen) isotope values of three species of hutias,,, and, alongside edible rat (sp.), and domestic guinea pig (). To estimate dietary source contributions, we employed a Bayesian dietary mixing model (FRUITS v.3.0) and ran three different permutations to assess the relative contributions of C3 or C4/CAM plants. The addition of an extra 79 wild C3 and 40 wild C4/CAM plant species' isotope values from published sources to an established isotopic foodweb for the Caribbean region enabled us to discriminate between wild and domestic C3 and C4/CAM plant food sources in two of these models. Our results provide evidence of the significant consumption of domestic C4/CAM plants by some animals. This likely represents maize () consumption, which is known to have been ubiquitously cultivated by indigenous peoples in the region. This is particularly the case for, as FRUITS modeling suggests that a few individuals consumed C4/CAM plants well beyond their expected natural diets as determined from feeding studies of extant hutia species. This may indicate human influence over endemic rodent diets due to niche construction activities such as horticultural practices and may reflect either opportunistic feeding on human produce or the purposeful supplementation of hutia diets by humans."

These insights have, to a large extent, been obtained by the extraction and identification of starch granules contained within the mineralised dental plaque from a wide range of regions and time periods. The scope of previous studies have been limited to microfossil extraction and identification to reconstruct dietary preferences from the archaeological record, and few studies have attempted to address the biases of starch retention in dental calculus. Those that have considered this problem have been limited tostudies on modern humans and non-human primates. Here, we present a multispecies oral biofilm model, which allows experimental research on starch incorporation and retention to be conducted ondental calculus in a controlled laboratory setting. The biofilms were exposed to treatment solutions with known quantities of dietary starches (wheat and potato) during the 25 days growth period. After this, the starch granules were extracted from the mature biofilm (by dissolution in EDTA), and counted. We show that the granule counts extracted from the model dental calculus represented a low proportion (ranging from 0.06% to 0.16%) of the total number of granules exposed to the biofilms throughout the experiment. Additionally, we found that the ratios of granule sizes from the extracted starch granules differed from the original treatment solutions, with large granules (>20m) consistently being under-represented. We also found a positive correlation between the absolute granule counts and dry-weight of the biofilm (= 0.659, 90%CI[0.463, 0.794]), meaning the absolute quantity of starch granules will increase as the size of the calculus deposit increases. A similar, but weaker correlation was found between the concentration (count per mg) of granules and dry-weight (= 0.3, 90%CI[0.0618, 0.506]). Our results complement and reinforce previousstudies suggesting that dental calculus presents a very small, and partly biased picture of the original dietary intake of starches, with an over-representation of plants producing granules smaller than 20m in size. The experimental model presented here is well-suited to address the need for further validation of methods and biases associated with dietary research on dental calculus."

The UNESCO World Heritage site of the Mapungubwe Cultural Landscape is one of the recent legal battlegrounds pitting the interests of the natural world and archaeological heritage against mining. Mineral resource extraction carries within its destruction creative potential too. In southern Africa mining has been instrumental in illuminating human history and in the creation of archaeological landmarks.The relationship between archaeology and mining is a complex one. The gold industry and associated lime-mining has specifically been instrumental in the development of palaeoanthropology in South Africa (Bonner 2007). With the discovery of gold, lime was required for the desulfurization process. This was obtained locally and many lime works were exploited during the 1890s (Esterhuysen 2019). The miners drew attention to fossils found within the deposits leading to the discovery of hominins at Taung, Makapan and Sterkfontein in the early 20th century. Mining may thus be seen as crucial to the genesis of the Cradle of Humankind UNESCO World Heritage site in South Africa. Similarly guano, zinc and vanadium mining have yielded important palaeoanthropological finds in southern Africa.In the 19th and early 20th century, scientific focus was on discovering unknown objects. In this context, the efficient removal of great quantities of overburden was a great asset. With increasing scientific rigour in the 20th century, archaeological focus shifts from objects to their interrelationships and their context. The documentation of finds and find contexts requires time that is not available in the context of industrial resource extraction. Fruitful collaboration now becomes more difficult. As the early lime works closed down in the first half of the 20th century, archaeologists were free to continue work at a comparative snail’s pace  but yielding far greater insight in the human past.In active mining operations, collaboration is difficult. While mining still exposes valuable sites and materials that would otherwise be inaccessible, this is of limited value in current archaeological practice. Current ethical standards emphasisepreservation of archaeological remains over excavation. When finds are documented, the time-pressure from mining companies makes these situations ambiguous in value. Examples are the discovery of Pleistocene shell middens after their partial destruction, or the recovery of lithic materials from conveyor belts in diamond plants.In the late 20th century and 21st century, the discipline of archaeology has been included in legal frameworks on environmental planning. Archaeological contractors conduct Heritage impact assessments and advise on mitigation measures for large-scale environmental projects such as mining operation and the building of large dams of infrastructure works.Highlighting human history was an unintended consequence for large mining operations. Yet both on a grand level, the activity of mining, as well as on a personal level, the activities of miners and foremen have played a crucial role in uncovering ancient humans and their world in southern Africa. I argue that the insights produced as a result of early resource extraction are one (albeit often minor) consideration in the network of values, stakeholders and resources that embed mining operations in society."

It unlocks two corpora of archaeological legacy data, which pertain to salvage excavations undertaken by a team of the Middle East Technical University (Ankara) in the period 1978-1989, in the wake of the site’s flooding by the Euphrates river. The dissertation integrates the excavation documentation with archaeological material nowadays stored at the Archaeological Museum of Adiyaman. In addition to a conventional analysis of the chronology, lay-out and architectural character of the palace, a critique is formulated on the problematic character of acculturative and anthropocentric approaches still characterizing scholarship dealing with ‘Hellenism in the East’. As an alternative, it is proposed to reconceptualize the palace of Samosata as a heterogenous and vibrant assemblage, with objects as historical protagonists rather than passive, representational entities. As such, the palace assemblage becomes a laboratory to study the impact of pre-modern globalization processes, with increased connectivity causing the emergence of new relations. Through an investigation of the genealogical and more-than representational capacities of the palace assemblage, the dissertation arrives at a new understanding of change and innovation in Commagene during the 1st c.

Currently, the analytical techniques used to visualize the internal structure of human dental calculus and entrapped inclusions are limited and require destructive sampling, which cannot always be justified.We used propagation phase-contrast synchrotron radiation micro-computed tomography (PPC-SR-μCT) to non-destructively examine the internal organization of dental calculus, including its microstructure and entrapped inclusions, on both modern and archeological samples.The virtual histological exploration of the samples shows that PPC-SR-μCT is a powerful approach to visualize the internal organization of dental calculus. We identified several important features, including previously undetected negative imprints of enamel and dentine growth markers (perikymata and periradicular bands, respectively), the non-contiguous structure of calculus layers with multiple voids, and entrapped plant remains.PPC-SR-μCT is an effective technique to explore dental calculus structural organization, and is especially powerful for enabling the identification of inclusions. The non-destructive nature of synchrotron tomography helps protect samples for future research. However, the irregular layers and frequent voids reveal a high heterogeneity and variability within calculus, with implications for research focusing on inclusions."

This collaborative project by The University of West Indies (UWI) Mona and Leiden University, under the supervision of the Jamaica National Heritage Trust (JNHT), recovered an extensive artifact and faunal assemblage along with a series of human burials. Our zooarchaeological analysis shows evidence of an increasing reliance over time on terrestrial animals, in particular the Jamaican hutia (Geocapromys brownii), a species theorized to have been managed by Indigenous peoples due to its ubiquity at precolonial sites. To assess whether the management of this species was occurring, we conducted morphometric analysis on 118 hutia mandibles, allowing us to estimate body mass and mortality ages. Our findings suggest that prime age individuals were being killed, with no examples of juveniles and few fully mature hutias within the assemblage. Some examples of bone pathologies indicate that these hutias were able to survive with hampered mobility. Stable isotope analysis of hutia bone collagen and tooth enamel was conducted which suggests that most hutias had elevated carbon values beyond what should be expected of their natural diets. This study also provides results from time series isotope sampling of one hutia incisor which may suggest changing patterns in consumption relating to seasonality. Our evidence of pathologies, isotopic evidence and mortality profile all indicate there was likely some form of management of hutias by the people of White Marl."

These problems are inherently linked with the discussion over controlled lab experiments vs actualistic layouts: one of the most contentious debates in experimental archaeology. More broadly, these issues are further tied to the crisis of confidence in experimental results and issues such as replicability and reproducibility. These concerns are even more significant in research attempting to simulate and investigate combat wear traces, where these problems also intertwine with the challenges that these layouts pose in terms of best practices to follow to ensure ethics and sustainability. In this paper, the methodological framework implemented in two experimental campaigns studying prehistoric bronze weaponry is discussed. The examples are then used to illustrate some of the challenges in these types of set-ups and to provide discussion points regarding potential solutions.

Faunal analyses from southern African sites have led to the development of influential hypotheses on the evolution of modern human hunting methods and subsistence economies. In the 1970s and 1980s, analysis of faunal remains from the Middle Stone Age site Klasies River informed the hypothesis that Middle Stone Age humans were less effective hunters than ethnographically documented huntergatherers. This was based on the underrepresentation of dangerous prey species in the bone assemblages. The development of detailed taphonomic research in the 1990s and 2000s demonstrated that the accumulation of faunal assemblages was the result of complex processes involving both human and nonhuman agents. These studies helped establish that Middle Stone Age hunters were as capable as those in ethnographically documented societies. Since then, important progress has been made in the identification of the weapons systems that were used to hunt animals. Analyses of lithic implements indicate bow-and-arrow use in southern Africa going back to at least 65,000 years ago. Animal exploitation strategies do change over time. Hunting strategies probably focused on large antelope during the Middle Pleistocene, and the importance of smaller animals increased This change was likely caused by a shift in prey populations that stemmed from a combination of environmental change and perhaps human population pressure. Late Pleistocene archaeological sites show increasing evidence for intensification; that is, an increase in the amount of food extracted from the environment by more thorough processing of prey, exploitation of new prey types, and development of new exploitation strategies. This pattern is usually linked to animal overexploitation and may be a result of human population expansion or environmental change if decreasing productivity limits the supply of animal prey. Notable examples of this are shellfish middens at coastal sites, the abundance of tortoises, and the presence of large numbers of small mammals that were likely snared instead of pursued."

Yet, evidence for their contemporaneity at any regional scale remains highly elusive. In France and northern Spain, a region which features some of the latest directly-dated Neandertals in Europe, Protoaurignacian assemblages attributed to Homo sapiens appear to 'replace' Neandertal-associated Chatelperronian assemblages. Using the earliest and latest known occurrences as starting points, Bayesian modelling has provided indication that these occupations may in fact have been partly contemporaneous. The reality, however, is that we are unlikely to ever identify the 'first' or 'last' appearance of a species or cultural tradition in the archaeological and fossil record. Here, we use optimal linear estimation modelling to estimate the first appearance date of Homo sapiens and the extinction date of Neandertals in France and northern Spain by statistically inferring these 'missing' portions of the Protoaurignacian and Chatelperronian archaeological records. Additionally, we estimate the extinction date of Neandertals in this region using a dataset of directly-dated Neandertal fossil remains. Our total dataset consists of sixty-six modernly produced radiocarbon determinations which we recalibrated using the newest calibration curve (IntCal20) to produce updated age ranges. The results suggest that the onset of the Homo sapiens occupation of this region likely preceded the extinction of Neandertals and the Chatelperronian by up to 1400-2900 years. This reaffirms the Bayesian-derived duration of co-existence between these groups during the initial Upper Palaeolithic of this region using a novel independent method, and indicates that our understanding of the timing of these occupations may not be suffering from substantial gaps in the record. Whether or not this co-existence featured some form of direct interaction, however, remains to be resolved."

In this paper we review and update global patterns in island colonization, synthesizing data from all the major island groups and theaters and undertaking quantitative and qualitative analysis of these data. We demonstrate the continued relevance of certain biogeographic and environmental factors in structuring how humans colonized islands during the Holocene. Our analysis also suggests the importance of other factors, some previously anticipated—such as culturally ingrained seafaring traditions and technological enhancement of dispersal capacity—but some not, such as the relationship between demographic growth and connectivity, differing trophic limitations impinging on colonizing farmers versus hunter-gatherer-foragers, and the constraining effects of latitude. We also connect colonization with continental dynamics: both the horizontal transmission of farming lifestyles earlier in the Holocene, and subsequent centrifugal processes associated with early state formation later in the Holocene."

Knowledge of the geographic provenance of the raw materials, in particular, can inform us of the mobility and resource exploitation strategies employed by past human groups. However, it is difficult to reliably infer dynamic human behaviours from the frequencies with which different raw material are represented at archaeological sites, particularly when the latter reflect the activities of individuals belonging to an extinct human species whose cognitive and physical abilities may have been markedly different from our own.This dissertation provides a new approach for understanding aspects of human adaptation in the Middle Palaeolithic on the basis of toolstone provenance. The approach centers on computer simulations and it is designed to maximize the potential of toolstone provenance information while minimizing reliance on possibly unfounded assumptions about human behaviour derived from studies of present-day societies. The approach is applied to the French Middle Palaeolithic site of the Bau de l’Aubesier, revealing, amongst other things, that the Neanderthal occupants of the site possessed excellent spatial memory and navigational abilities, regularly exploited a surprisingly large area, and appear to have treated stone resources in a strictly utilitarian manner."

Until recently, these data were only accessible through metadata search. We implemented a text retrieval engine for a large archaeological text collection (~658 million words). In archaeological IR, domain-specific entities such as locations, time periods and artefacts play a central role. This motivated the development of a named entity recognition (NER) model to annotate the full collection with archaeological named entities. In this article, we present ArcheoBERTje, a BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model pre-trained on Dutch archaeological texts. We compare the model’s quality and output on an NER task to a generic multilingual model and a generic Dutch model. We also investigate ensemble methods for combining multiple BERT models, and combining the best BERT model with a domain thesaurus using conditional random fields. We find that ArcheoBERTje outperforms both the multilingual and Dutch model significantly with a smaller standard deviation between runs, reaching an average F1 score of 0.735. The model also outperforms ensemble methods combining the three models. Combining ArcheoBERTje predictions and explicit domain knowledge from the thesaurus did not increase the F1 score. We quantitatively and qualitatively analyse the differences between the vocabulary and output of the BERT models on the full collection and provide some valuable insights in the effect of fine-tuning for specific domains. Our results indicate that for a highly specific text domain such as archaeology, further pre-training on domain-specific data increases the model’s quality on NER by a much larger margin than shown for other domains in the literature, and that domain-specific pre-training makes the addition of domain knowledge from a thesaurus unnecessary."

The data originate from archaeological sources, as written texts are not suited to the purpose.  Samenvatting – De diversiteit van de Nederlandse akkerflora staat onder druk. De grote rijkdom van vroeger dreigt verloren te gaan. ‘Vroeger’ is echter een relatief begrip. Bij het begin van de akkerbouw in Nederland, 5300 v. Chr., was deze flora veel minder rijk dan in de afgelopen eeuwen. Aan de hand van plantenresten uit opgravingen is gekeken naar verandering in diversiteit sinds het verschijnen van de eerste akkers. Onderzocht zijn de in dit materiaal determineerbare kensoorten van de Stellarietea mediae Tüxen, Lohmeyer et Preising in Tüxen 1950, de Klasse der akkergemeenschappen. De diversiteit neemt in de loop der millennia toe, ook na correctie voor veranderingen in oogstmethoden. De archeologische bronnen betreffen namelijk hoofdzakelijk geoogste producten en oogstafval en deze geven daarom een vertekend beeld van de oorspronkelijke flora.

Today, OA is often observed in the hands and wrists, yet there have been few dedicated studies in past populations. This research aims to investigate how the living environment impacts the occurrence and patterning of hand and wrist OA in the medieval Netherlands.Materials & MethodsThe skeletal remains of 226 adult individuals from three sites (urban Alkmaar, rural Klaaskinderkerke, and urban hospital Kampen) were analysed to shed light on past prevalence and variation in affected joints between contextually different populations. The operational definition from Waldron (2009) was used to diagnose OA. ResultsExpectedly, a significant relationship between age and OA prevalence was found, χ2(2, N=226)=26.72, p<.001), with older individuals being more affected. Sex did not influence OA prevalence, χ2(2, N=226)=.75, p=0.68). Interestingly, even though the age distribution between the sites was similar, a clear interpopulation difference in overall hand and wrist OA prevalence was observed: hospital (32%), urban (12%) and rural (5%). Joint-specific patterning also showed variation between the sites, with OA predominance in the lateral wrist (thumb-base/wrist joint complex) in the urban hospital population, and in the medial wrist (piso-triquetral) in the urban population.  ConclusionsThese results suggest that population context plays a significant role in OA occurrence. Differences in OA prevalence and patterning may suggest different activities or risk factors depending on the environment, which need to be explored further and on a larger scale."

The semi-mobile community in Togolok 1 presents a remarkable materialculture among the semi-mobile excavated contexts in the Murghab region. Although archaeologicalevidence in Togolok suggests a semi-mobile identity, the overall morphological and iconographicalanalysis of small objects shows strong cultural associations with the sedentary BMAC (Bactro-MargianaArchaeological Complex) communities. Moreover, the association with sedentary communities isconsistent with the economic activities, which suggest a constant interplay between pastoralism andfarming. Therefore, we propose that the community settled in Togolok 1 was reshaped by the intenseeconomic and cultural interaction with the neighbouring BMAC communities."

It is critical that age-at-death methods be tested verified in various populations, to obtain the most accurate estimation, making research into new age-at-death methods also imperative. Since osteophyte formation on the vertebral column increases with age, this can be used as a possible method of age-at-death estimation. Snodgrass (2004), Watanabe and Terazawa (2006) and Praneatpolgrang et al. (2019) have tested this method before and have provided promising results. We test the efficacy of Snodgrass (2004), Watanabe and Terazawa (2006), and Praneatpolgrang et al. (2019) on a 19th-century archivally recorded Dutch population. A total of 88 individuals, 40 males, and 48 females were scored for the degree of osteophyte formation on the vertebral column. In addition to testing the three methods above, population-specific regression equations were developed and tested. Accuracy percentages for estimating the age-at-death based on the mean osteophyte score of the entire vertebral column were obtained for all three methods (73.86%, 76.14%, and 72.73%, respectively). In this study, a general pattern of osteophyte formation could be established, which is useful for estimating the age at death. We therefore recommend that this method can be used, cautiously as a means of age-at-death estimation."

While many studies have focused on hunting and meat acquisition, less attention has been given to gathering and plant foods. Despite evidence of variation in both nutritional quality and energetic costs of gathering different plants, the overall effort spent on gathering in relation to other subsistence tasks is still under explored. In the current context of economic, climate, and social changes, many forager societies also rely on other subsistence strategies, including agriculture and wage labor. In this study, we aim to explore the place of gathering in the livelihood of a mixed economy society, the Baka forager-horticulturalists of southeastern Cameroon, by comparing the involvement and the costs of activities related to food acquisition. From a pool of 153 adult participants (97 women and 56 men), we collected 246 daily records using a GPS (Global Positioning System) tracker combined with heart rate monitor and time allocation recalls. We compared the duration, distance traveled, and the intensity of work, measured by calculating the metabolic equivalent of task (MET), of subsistence activities related to food acquisition. Results from this work show that gathering activities, performed by both women and men, are energetically costly, with higher MET values than hunting and fishing activities. Furthermore, the MET values vary depending on the targeted plant foods. We discuss these insights in the overall framework of subsistence patterns, merging them with the socio-cultural and environmental factors that might explain Baka livelihood and subsistence strategy."

To understand this, we generated genome-wide data from 793 individuals, increasing data from the Middle to Late Bronze and Iron Age in Britain by 12-fold, and Western and Central Europe by 3.5-fold. Between 1000 and 875 BC, EEF ancestry increased in southern Britain (England and Wales) but not northern Britain (Scotland) due to incorporation of migrants who arrived at this time and over previous centuries, and who were genetically most similar to ancient individuals from France. These migrants contributed about half the ancestry of Iron Age people of England and Wales, thereby creating a plausible vector for the spread of early Celtic languages into Britain. These patterns are part of a broader trend of EEF ancestry becoming more similar across central and western Europe in the Middle to Late Bronze Age, coincident with archaeological evidence of intensified cultural exchange2-6. There was comparatively less gene flow from continental Europe during the Iron Age, and Britain's independent genetic trajectory is also reflected in the rise of the allele conferring lactase persistence to ~50% by this time compared to ~7% in central Europe where it rose rapidly in frequency only a millennium later. This suggests that dairy products were used in qualitatively different ways in Britain and in central Europe over this period."

De collectie van zo'n 3000 objecten is bestudeerd en beschreven in een uitgebreide publicatie.Deel 1 van de publicatie behandelt alle numismatische- (of: 'munt-') vondsten van de Romeinse- tot de Nieuwe tijd. Aan de hand van de munten wordt de Noord-Hollandse en Nederlandse muntgeschiedenis zichtbaar, van een Romeinse denarius uit 82 v. Chr. en een vroegmiddeleeuwse Engelse styca (725-900) tot Hollandse penningen uit de tijd van Floris V (1256-1296) in de Late Middeleeuwen. In de Nieuwe tijd zien we in de munten in de collectie de weerslag van de Tachtigjarige Oorlog en komen munten zoals stuiver, Leeuwendaalder en de gulden op.In het tweede deel komen de niet-numismatische vondsten aan bod. Deze objecten laten het 'gewone' leven zien van het platteland, van ambacht, handel en kleding maar ook van vrijetijd en vermaak en religie zoals lakenloodjes, knopen, gespen, pelgrimsinsignes en musketkogels.Beide delen bevatten een uitgebreide catalogus met foto's en specificaties van de metaalvondsten."

By assessing the diversity of research aims, artistic projects, creative practices and technology used in the contributions to the Special Issue, and drawing on the thoughts and perspectives generated during the roundtable discussion, we seek to identify shared challenges within the community of visualizers which could ultimately pave the way to shared practices. In this light, we assess whether established charters and guidelines are still relevant in a now matured digital archaeology, where visualization techniques have attained a central position in archaeological knowledge production. Although parts of the guidelines have become common practice, the remainder did not keep up with the fast pace of development of digital practice and its current fundamental role in archaeology, and as a result some of the guidelines risk becoming obstructive in archaeological creative practice."

However, the amount of available high-quality, remotely-sensed data is continuously growing at a staggering rate, which creates new challenges to effectively and efficiently analyze these data and find and document the seemingly overwhelming number of potential archaeological objects. Therefore, computer-aided methods for the automated detection of archaeological objects are needed. In this thesis, the development and application of automated detection methods, based on Deep Convolutional Neural Networks, for the detection of multiple classes of archaeological objects in LiDAR data is investigated. Furthermore, the implementation of these methods into archaeological practice and the opportunities of knowledge discovery—on both a quantitative and qualitative level—for landscape or spatial archaeology are explored."

A portable laser ablation system was used to sample jade celts and bodily ornaments on site in a quasi-non-destructive manner. Low-blank trace element and Sr-Nd isotope ratio data were evaluated with a multiclass regression provenance prediction model.This study demonstrates that the pan-Caribbean exchange of jade raw materials, pre-forms or finished objects during the Ceramic Age (400 BC to AD 1492) occurred on a more complex scale than previously thought involving jade sources in Guatemala, eastern Cuba and the northern Dominican Republic. In addition, the study of ornaments recovered from St. Croix reveals use of specific lithologies suggesting stronger ties to Indigenous communities on Puerto Rico than other Lesser Antillean Islands."

Our approach consists of two steps: (1) identify the possible range of hunter-gatherer impacts on landscapes based on ethnographic studies; (2) evaluate proxies possibly reflecting these impacts for both the Eemian (Last Interglacial, Middle Palaeolithic) and the Early–Middle Holocene (Mesolithic). We found these paleoenvironmental proxies were not able to unequivocally establish clear-cut differences between specific anthropogenic, climatic and megafaunal impacts for either time period in this area. We discuss case studies for both periods and show that published evidence for Mesolithic manipulation of landscapes is based on the interpretation of comparable data as available for the Last Interglacial. If one applies the ‘Mesolithic’ interpretation schemes to the Neanderthal record, three common niche construction activities can be hypothesised: vegetation burning, plant manipulation and impact on animal species presence and abundance. Our review suggests that as strong a case can be made for a Neanderthal impact on landscapes as for anthropogenic landscape changes during the Mesolithic, even though the Neanderthal evidence comes from only one high-resolution site complex. Further research should include attempts (by means of modelling studies) to establish whether hunter-gatherer impact on landscapes played out at a local level only versus at a larger scale during both time periods, while we also need to obtain comparative data on the population sizes of Last Interglacial and Holocene hunter-gatherers, as these are usually inferred to have differed significantly."

The flint industry, also typical of this period, is characterized by quite a broad range of raw materials. Sandstone artefacts were mainly used for polishing activities. Although faunal remains are mostly of domestic species, the proportion of wild animals in the assemblage is relatively high. Certain features also produced burnt daub, as well as carbonised plant remains, including cereals, legumes and hazel nut. The excavated features are probably part of a small settlement that was linked in some way to the large neighbouring site of Menneville ""Derrière le Village""."

Tracing its origin in the early colonial accounts one finds that this denomination (as ‘sacrifice-to-the-devil’ in combination with cannibalism) was used by the Spaniards in a systematic propagandistic fasion as part of the demonisation of the Aztec and other Mesoamerican cultures with the aim of justifying the colonial invasion.Many descriptions are evidently no eye-witness testimonies but based on hearsay and imagination. In a number of cases it is even doubtful that people were killed. In other cases, the killings, though maybe caried out in a ritualised context, seem not to have been actually first and foremost ‘sacrifices’, but rather forms of death penalty, execution, political murder or other instances of (in principle secular) homicide.In order to construct this hostile image, the colonial accounts misrepresented socially sanctioned killings, confusing them with religious acts such as ancestor worship and specific funerary customs, as well as with the frequent self sacrifice (bloodletting).There is an important though often overlooked parallel with the contemporaneous accusations of “witchcraft” against innocent women in European societies. But where modern scholarly consensus holds that the allegations of the witch craze were unwaranted, in the case of the “human sacrifice’ contemporary studies (also our own) have often still reproduced the terminology of the colonial demonisation. After 500 years it is time for a decolonial historical critique."

To the south lay the Nabataean kingdom, annexed by Rome in 106 and formed into the province of Arabia. To the north, the Cappadocian frontier was laid out in one of the most inaccessible and remote parts of Eurasia facing extremes of climate and topography, amid a patchwork of client kingdoms.

Studying dietary change through carious lesions and stable isotope analysis,"Schats, R.; Hattum, IJ. van; Kootker, L.M.; Hoogland, M.L.P.; Waters‐Rist, A.L.                                                         2021",,Article / Letter to editor,open access,"In the late medieval period, Holland experienced substantial socio-economic change. While the region was largely undeveloped prior to 1200 CE, the period after was characterised by extensive urbanisation and flourishing international trade, changes that would have impacted many aspects of life. This paper investigates the effect of these changes on diet by comparing skeletal collections from the early/central medieval rural village of Blokhuizen (800–1200 CE) to the late medieval urban town of Alkmaar (1448–1572 CE) using a combination of the prevalence and location of carious lesions (teeth = 3475) and stable carbon and nitrogen isotope data (= 50). Results show that the urban Alkmaar population had a significantly higher caries frequency (7.4% vs. 16.1%), starting at a younger age. Moreover, Alkmaar had significantly more approximal caries. These results point to increased consumption of cariogenic products, such as sugars and starches, by the urban citizens. Dietary differences are also demonstrated by the stable isotope data. Alkmaar individuals have significantly enriched15N ratios and more variable13C ratios compared with rural Blokhuizen. The elevated15N values may be due to increased consumption of fish or animals such as omnivorous pigs and chickens. The combination of caries and isotopic data points to clear changes in diet suggesting that urban individuals in the late medieval period had a substantially different diet compared with early rural inhabitants from the same area. Specifically, an increase in market dependence, availability of international trade products, and the growth of commercial fishing in the late medieval period may have contributed to this dietary shift. Future research should include a late medieval rural population to better understand the effects of late medieval socio-economic developments outside of the urban environment. This study demonstrates that the integration of palaeopathology and stable isotopic research provides a more complete understanding of dietary changes in medieval Holland."

We checked origin, life form, domestication and conservation status and the plant parts that are represented. We identified 198 taxa, consisting mostly of wild, native rainforest trees and 35 introduced species. Fertile branches are the most represented, although some loose dry fruits and sterile material were also painted, which sheds light into the collection methods by naturalists in Dutch Brazil. Several species are no longer abundant or have become invasive due to anthropogenic influences since colonialism.

The main technocomplexes represented are Still Bay, Howiesons Poort, Sibudan, final MSA and Robberg (from old to young). Changing selection of raw materials is an important issue in the study of the Middle-to-Later Stone Age transition that appears characterised by a shift in raw material use in addition to a technological organisation. Umhlatuzana was first excavated in 1975 by Jonathan Kaplan who suggested that the lithic assemblage of the Pleistocene deposits consisted mainly of quartz (61%), hornfels (37.6%), and quartzite (1.4%) (Kaplan 1990). Renewed excavations at the site were conducted during 2018 and 2019. This campaign aims to clarify the site’s formation processes employing micromorphological analysis and other techniques (Reidsma et al. 2021, Sifogeorgaki et al. 2020). Micromorphology uses thin sections of undisturbed sediment samples for  microscopic studies. The sections allow a petrological inspection of rock fragments embedded in the deposits. Rather unexpectedly, the Umhlatuzana thin sections yield different raw material determinations than Kaplan (1990). While quartz and hornfels are present (around 23% and 25% respectively), they represent a much less sizable proportion than previously reported. Instead, the most prominent raw material observed is a quartz arenite sandstone (42%). Quartzite fragments were not detected.We therefore initiated an in-depth mineralogical and elemental classification of the raw materials.  We distinguish 6 raw material types based on the thin section analysis: sandstone, quartz, hornfels, dolerite, chert and diorite. We then determined the elemental composition of the raw material types of the micromorphology samples using p-XRF. Additionally, p-XRF analysis was conducted on c. 100 specimens from the 2018-2019 excavation lithic collection. This allowed us to determine elemental characteristics of the raw materials used during the Pleistocene occupation of the site. Subsequently, p-XRF analysis was systematically performed on a larger sample set of lithics from the site in order to correctly determine their raw material type. The combination of micromorphological and p-XRF analysis of the Umhlatuzana assemblages demonstrates that if only visual inspection is done, the variability of raw materials used may be misinterpreted and the relative frequency of different rock types in an assembly may be over- or underestimated. Future work will aim at re-visiting the raw material categorization of artefacts excavated during the 1975 excavations."

However, many developments were already started long before Julius Caesar's Roman armies arrived in the southern Netherlands. The Iron Age landscapes were ordered and structured, contrasting with the still open Bronze Age landscapes. Iron Age people inhabited the same places for generations. At the same time they structured their immediate environment and surroundings resulting in a sustainable organisation and arrangement of the landscape.Recent excavations and (micro-)regional archaeological studies into habitation and landscape organisation, among others in the north-eastern region of the province Noord-Brabant, show that relicts from the past strongly dictated the organisation and structuring of later landscapes. The past in the past formed a guideline (dutch: leidraad) for later (Iron Age) inhabitants.The past can also be a guideline for the design, protection and preservation of contemporary landscapes. This aligns with a trend in which archaeologists are explicitly seeking the connection with present society. Therefore this book ends with a plea for a transition of the Dutch archaeological system in which living heritage can also be a guideline for the present."

Understanding this transition in southern Africa is complicated by the paucity of archaeological sites that span this period. With its occupation sequence spanning the last ~70,000 years, Umhlatuzana Rock Shelter is one of the few sites that record this transition. Umhlatuzana thus offers a great opportunity to study past environmental dynamics from the Late Pleistocene (MIS 4) to the Late Holocene, and past human subsistence strategies, their social organisation, technological and symbolic innovations. Although organic preservation is poor (bones, seeds, and charcoal) at the site, silica phytoliths preserve generally well throughout the sequence. These microscopic silica particles can identify different plant types that are no longer visible at the site because of decomposition or burning to a reliable taxonomical level. Thus, to trace site occupation, plant resource use, and in turn reconstruct past vegetation, we applied phytolith analyses to sediment samples of the newly excavated Umhlatuzana sequence. We present results of the phytolith assemblage variability to determine change in plant use from the Pleistocene to the Holocene and discuss them in relation to taphonomical processes and human plant gathering strategies and activities. This study ultimately seeks to provide a palaeoenvironmental context for modes of occupation and will shed light on past human-environmental interactions in eastern South Africa."

Analyses of organic residues in ceramics have attested to the cooking of aquatic foods, ruminant meat, porcine meat, as well as rare cases of dairy. In terms of vegetative matter, some ceramics exclusively yielded evidence of wild plants, while others preserve cereal remains. Elevated δ15N values of human were interpreted as demonstrating an important aquatic component of the diet well into the 4th millennium BC. Yet recent assays on livestock remains suggest grazing on salt marshes partly accounts for the human values. Finally, renewed archaeozoological investigations have shown the early presence of domestic animals to be more limited than previously thought. We discuss the relative importance of exploited resources to produce a best-fit interpretation of changing patterns of land-use during the Middle Swifterbant phase. Our review combines recent archaeological data with wider data on anthropogenic influence on the landscape. Combining the results of plant macroremains, information from pollen cores about vegetation development, the structure of faunal assemblages, and finds of arable fields and dairy residue, we suggest the most parsimonious interpretation is one of a limited land-use footprint of cultivation and livestock keeping in Dutch wetlands between 4600 and 3900 BCE."

Paradoxically, this technical perspective highlights the human factor. We see 19th- and early 20th-century weavers’ decisions in close-up, as if sitting next to them. This yields rich insights in both materiality and creativity. It also allowed the differentiation of 21 weave types and their distribution across 41 regions in the Indonesian archipelago.Asymmetry is widely distributed, yet has largely been ignored. Ten Hoopen discriminates seven techniques to achieve asymmetry, including visual tricks and illusions. Sumbanese royal weavers made thrilling efforts to hide their virtuosity, using tiny visual devices, secret keys, to reveal that their creations were far more labour-intensive than apparent. Ironically, because they were such great masters at hiding their virtuosity, it remained overlooked by generations of scholars.In his final chapter the author analyses what may have spurred the weavers of the region to create their most time-consuming feats of artistry, and develops a view of these women as more inventive and intelligent than they have been credited with before – and more assertive, using ikat’s prestige to spin their men into a web of taboos and prescriptions."

One could even argue that the ziggurat is a transhistorical symbol; it has existed as a symbol not only produced by and related to the ancient Near East, but has transcended its original historical context and has acquired new meanings and images over time. In this article, I explore this transhistoricity of the ziggurat by examining it within western, modern, popular imagination, and particularly within the context of video games. For this, I take an art-historical approach, examining ziggurats from various games to create a ziggurat typology as portrayed in video games. In doing that, I explore how modern conceptions of the ziggurat affect and shape our understanding of the Near East, and how this can be tied to Edward Said’s concept of orientalism (see also Mol and Politopoulos in this issue). I conclude with a brief discussion on how we can reframe the ziggurat within popular culture in order to increase knowledge and awareness about the history and cultures of the ancient Near East today."

What does the community actually believe about the demise of Neanderthals? To address this question, we conducted a survey among practicing palaeo-anthropologists (total number of respondents = 216). It appears that received wisdom is that demography was the principal cause of the demise of Neanderthals. In contrast, there is no received wisdom about the role that environmental factors and competition with modern humans played in the extinction process; the research community is deeply divided about these issues. Finally, we tested the hypothesis that palaeo-anthropologists’ stand in the debate co-varies with their socio-political views and attitudes. We found no evidence for such a correlation."

In order to do this, the costs, in labour, of certain structures are calculated. These labour costs are calculated for various sub-processes of the construction process. However, since such a calculation will never be able to provide an absolute answer, there are simply to many uncertainties and unknowns, the relative costs of the studied fortifications can inform about the scale of the required investments. To be able to make comparisons, not only fortifications are studied, but a number of domestic structures as well.The research has shown that the impressive style in which the fortifications are constructed, using massive blocks of stone, is not, in itself, an overly expensive building style. The decorative styles at certain gates, however, is an expense style and is therefore only used sparingly. The fortifications themselves are expensive endeavours, but not beyond the capabilities of communities, as long as no other major issues were being a factor simultaneously."

To model the likely technological niches of extinct populations, we combine ecological principles (competitive exclusion) with physical anthropology and the archaeological record. We test the framework by applying it to the co-existence ofandduring the late Middle Pleistocene in southern Africa. Based on our analysis, we suggest that tool use was probably not an essential part of’s niche, but that technology occasionally provided caloric benefits. In contrast, tool use was a structural part of theway of life. We provide reasoning for our interpretation that the latter population is associated with more sophisticated reduction strategies and the development of prepared core technology. The method also has applicability to cases such as the co-existence of different toolmakers during the Earlier Stone Age (ESA) in East Africa and the co-existence of Neanderthals andin Eurasia."

The analysis shows that 70.3% of all rings could not be perceptibly distinguished from a ring weighing 195.5 grams, indicating their suitability as commodity money. Perceptive weight equivalence is demonstrated between rings, and a selection of ribs and axe blades. Co-occurrence of these objects evidences their interchangeability. We further suggest that producing copies of rings led to recognition of weight similarities and the independent emergence of a system of weighing in Central Europe at the end of the Early Bronze Age."

Combining aerial photogrammetry, archaeological fieldwork, and GIS-based analysis, more than 600 geoglyphs in the vicinity of the modern town of Palpa were recorded and analyzed. This interdisciplinary approach enabled the establishment of the first digital archive of these prehispanic monuments. It also led to important new insights into the origin, development, and spatial context of the geoglyphs. The Palpa dataset was furthermore used to test a recent model that explains the function and meaning of the Nasca geoglyphs in terms of Andean social, cultural, and religious traditions. The results of this study indicate that the ancient activities which took place on the geoglyphs revolved around concepts of water and fertility, and were a means of expressing social status and cultural concepts. The geoglyphs integrated the desert into the cultural landscape of the valley-based Paracas and Nasca societies, and were thus a valuable cultural resource that can still be appreciated today."

Cribra orbitalia is generally associated with childhood anaemia, but the underlying cause of this red blood cell disorder is still debated. Gowland and Westen (2012) showed a clear correlation between cribra orbitalia prevalence and certain geographic areas in the UK, linking this to malaria. As the Netherlands was plagued by malaria as well, this parasitic infection may have been an important contributing factor to the prevalence of anaemia in the medieval period. To contribute to this complex debate on the aetiology, and to study the hypothesis of malaria as an important causative agent, this research investigates the spatial distribution of cribra orbitalia in the medieval Netherlands. In total, 1629 individuals from 19 different medieval sites have been studied for the presence or absence of cribra orbitalia and severity of the lesions (1 to 3, Stuart-Macadam 1985). Results show a greater prevalence of cribra orbitalia in the areas deemed malarial based on palaeogeographic and 20th century malaria distribution data (10.9% vs. 23.1%, p<0.001). Yet, even though the mean scores are slightly higher in the malarial area, the severity of the lesions does not significantly vary. This study suggests that malaria may have been an important contributing factor to the prevalence of cribra orbitalia and that it was likely an influential disease in the low-lying coastal areas of the Netherlands with a substantial impact on health and life expectancy."

Small amounts of lithic off-site material have been found all over the south-eastern part of La Désirade, indicating that this area was incidentally used for the exploitation of local raw materials for the production of lithic artefacts. Concentrated and repeated activity, related to the exploitation of La Désirade chert, took place at four lithic workshops.This paper aims to reconstruct social and economic patterns, which may shed a light on prehistoric Amerindian territoriality and mobility, based on the exploitation and distribution of this local raw material. An inventory was made of sites where La Désirade chert was exploited and worked and of sites where this material showed up in the form of worked items.The La Désirade chert has been found in several prehistoric site assemblages outside La Désirade itself. However, it turns out to have a very restricted distribution, not exceeding 30 km distances from the raw material occurrences. The authors concluded that exploiting these sources may have been embedded in the general procurement strategy of the seafaring communities involved and that the observed distribution may demonstrate the extent of the territory of closely related communities that exploited a similar catchment area."

The efficacy of radiocarbon dating was thoroughly tested in this study, especially in regard to the tiny quantities that could be sampled from the skull. However, with the newly revamped radiocarbon facility at the University of Groningen, this was an opportune moment to attempt such research. Ultimately, a credible result could not be obtained on the skull; however, the ceremonial knife was dated reliably to the Aztec period. The article also discusses the broader issue of whether radio­carbon results can be used as a definitive proof of authenticity and examines the risk­reward nature of radiocarbon testing."

Prevalence, co-occurrence, and association of lesions and their link to sex and age-at-death were assessed.ResultsA clear link between prevalence of the lesions and age-at-death is found. Co-occurrence and association of all three lesions is uncommon. There is a significant moderate correlation for cribra humeri-femora in non-adults.ConclusionsLesion prevalence is connected to age-at-death. However, while a similar age distribution and associations between pairs of lesions are noted, due to limited co-occurrence of the three lesions, the presence of a ‘cribrous syndrome’ cannot supported.SignificanceThis is the first study investigating the prevalence, co-occurrence and association of cribra orbitalia, cribra humeri, and cribra femora in non-adults and adults contributing to discussions about the nature and the much-debated aetiology of these commonly encountered skeletal lesions.LimitationsThe number of non-adults in this study is limited, potentially obscuring meaningful patterns, as the cribrous lesions are significantly more common in younger individuals.Suggestions for further researchMore research into the prevalence of the post-cranial lesions and their co-occurrence as well as into bone growth and remodelling is warranted."

The presence of both Middle and Later Stone Age assemblages makes Umhlatuzana the ideal location for the study of the MSA–LSA transition (20–40 ka) in southern Africa. This transitional period is characterized by important modifications in stone tool technology, from prepared core technology to a toolkit based on microlith production. These changes are argued to have occurred in response to changes in climate and environment leading up to the Last Glacial Maximum. The deposits bearing the transitional assemblages at Umhlatuzana rockshelter appear homogeneous with no visible stratigraphic boundaries. This study integrates geoarchaeological techniques in order to explore fine-resolution geochemical differentiations of the sediments that are macroscopically invisible, and that will provide insight into (post-)depositional processes over time. Samples were systematically retrieved from the western profile of the site following a grid-based sampling strategy and analyzed for pH, elemental composition (XRF), and Magnetic Susceptibility. Additionally, the results were integrated with preliminary micromorphological observations. Our study reveals a steady, gradual change in the geochemistry of the deposits throughout the Pleistocene, related to a combination of environmental change and occupation intensity. We suggest that the part of the sequence reported to bear Middle to Later Stone Age transitional industries is characterized by wetter environmental conditions compared to the underlying deposits. Additionally, we support results from previous studies that excluded large scale post-depositional movement of the sedimentary sequence. Our study offers a successful multi-proxy approach to systematically sample and study archaeological deposits at the macro and micro scale, integrating a variety of geoarchaeological techniques. The approach provides insight into the depositional and post-depositional history of the site, and allows for questions of stratigraphic integrity, anthropogenic input, preservation, and environmental change to be addressed."

Owing to a sparse archaeological record, relatively little is known about these eastern Neanderthal populations. Unlike in their western range, there are limited zooarchaeological and paleobotanical studies that inform us about the nature of their subsistence. Here, we perform a combined analysis of carbon and nitrogen stable isotopes on bone collagen and microbotanical remains in dental calculus to reconstruct the diet of eastern Neanderthals at Chagyrskaya Cave in the Altai Mountains of Southern Siberia, Russia. Stable isotopes identify one individual as possessing a high trophic level due to the hunting of large- and medium-sized ungulates, while the analysis of dental calculus also indicates the presence of plants in the diet of this individual and others from the site. These findings indicate eastern Neanderthals may have had broadly similar subsistence patterns to those elsewhere in their range."

Recent studies incorporating scientific methods have revived the traditional hypothesis, that the sudden appearance of the CWC was caused by mass migrations from the Pontic Caspian steppe. Among other things, this new archaeological culture is typically associated with the introduction of a binary gender system and the establishment of a patriarchal society.However, such a narrative is largely rooted in andro- and ethnocentric, Western assumptions: biological sex is equated with gender, grave goods are taken as a direct representation of identity, and weapons (i.e. the CW ‘battle-axe’) are associated with masculinity. Moreover, burials under barrows are overrepresented in the ‘grand narrative’ of the CWC, while other funerary and depositional contexts are underrepresented.This paper aims to investigate CW gender, while taking the abovementioned problems into account. The emphasis is placed on the expression of gender through material culture and its selective deposition (i.e. specific objects deposited in specific contexts). Two regions have been selected as a case study: Southern Jutland (102 burials, 13 depositions (i.e. buried objects without a body), 29 single finds) and Bavaria (90 burials, three depositions, 32 single finds). The co-occurrences of various object categories in different depositional contexts are studied in each region. The results are contextualised in comparison to the extensive network analysis by Q. Bourgeois and E. Kroon (2017), which consisted of 1161 CW burials and resulted in the recognition of striking burial norms, but only takes the funerary context into account.The present comparative and multi-contextual study adds nuance to the binary reading of CW gender and suggests that CW gender may have been constructed through an interplay of normative supra-regional versus idiosyncratic local identities. The supra-regional and local burial styles do not necessarily convey a ‘male’ and ‘female’ gender identity but emphasise the larger CW community and local values respectively. Thus, this study argues that the core value displayed in burials is the CW community, rather than gender and particularly ‘male-dominant’, martial values as suggested in the grand narrative of this period."

The Balkan Middle Paleolithic often remains outside of the major debates and interpretations of Neandertal behavior. This dissertation is a contribution to better understanding the variability and diachronic changes of the Middle Paleolithic in the Balkans. The central part of this dissertation is the study of lithic collections from two stratified sites in the Adriatic region, Crvena stijena and Bioče (Montenegro). The assemblages from these sites have been previously grouped into the Micromousterian, but other Mousterian variants, Pontinian, Charentian, Denticulate and Typical Mousterian, have also been recognized. In trying to depart from tight attachment to Mousterian facies this dissertation examines flake production methods and toolkit production, the ways these two aspects correlate, and how they relate to raw material properties, and core and tool reduction intensities. Further, based on the review of the available record of the entire Balkan Middle Paleolithic, the dissertation explores trends in its chronological and geographical variation and compares them to the currently known variation of the Middle Paleolithic industries in Europe. It further addresses the questions of the role of the Balkans as a refugium, occupational history of Neandertals and the scenarios for their demise."

These approaches are generally tested in an (ideal) experimental setting but have not been applied in different contexts or ‘in the wild’, that is, incorporated in archaeological prospection. This research explores the applicability, knowledge discovery—on both a quantitative and qualitative level—and efficiency gain resulting from employing an automated detection tool called WODAN within (Dutch) archaeological practice. WODAN has been used to detect barrows and Celtic fields in LiDAR data from the Dutcharea, which differs in archaeology, geo-(morpho)logy and land-use from thein which it was developed. The results show that WODAN was able to detect potential barrows and Celtic fields, including previously unknown examples, and provided information about the structuring of the landscape in the past. Based on the results, combined human-computer strategies are argued, in which automated detection has a complementary, rather than a substitute role, to manual analysis. This can offset the inherent biases in manual analysis and deal with the problem that current automated detection methods only detect objects similar to the pre-defined target class(es). The incorporation of automated detection into archaeological prospection, in which the results of automated detection are used to highlight areas of interest and to enhance and add detail to existing archaeological predictive maps, seems logical and feasible."

In this corner of Europe, also known as the ‘Lower-Rhine-Basin,’ these cemeteries are often characterised by vast collections of small burial mounds under which the cremated remains of decedents were buried in small shaft-like pits. In many a case the cremated remains had been put in urns first, providing these cemeteries with their very name. Though rich in numbers, urnfield graves are often described as ‘poor’ and ‘simple’ as only in rare occasions decedents were provided with grave gifts. However, when close attention is paid to the actions involved in the creation of these seemingly simple graves, they in fact reveal a richness in funerary practices that on their turn hint a complex and intricate mortuary process. This book delves into the wealth of funerary practices reflected in more than 3,000 urnfield graves excavated throughout the Netherlands in order to reconstruct the mortuary process associated with the urnfields in this particular corner of Europe. Together these graves tell interesting stories about how the dead related to each other, how plain and simple objects could be used as metaphors in the creation of relational and ancestral identities and how the dead were inextricably linked to the land."

Furthermore, the gradual change within the geochemical data indicates that no large-scale sediment mixing took place (contrary to previous suggestions), while small-scale mixing related to bioturbation is visible in the micromorphological thin sections. Our study offers a successful multi-proxy approach to systematically sample and analyse archaeological deposits at the macro and micro scale, integrating a variety of geoarchaeological techniques. The approach provides insight into the depositional and postdepositional history of the site, and allows questions of stratigraphic integrity, anthropogenic input, preservation, and environmental change to be addressed."

The site is located in the southeastern part of the island, an area vulnerable to extreme wave events. The archaeological deposits are dated to 1290–780 cal BP (2σ). The earliest horizon is buried under thick layers of mangrove sediments. The deeply buried deposits have allowed excellent preservation of inorganic and organic remains providing an unexpected opportunity to reconstruct the paleoenvironmental conditions of past human settlement, and to study human-environment interactions and social adaptation to climate challenges in this part of the Caribbean archipelago. The cultural remains provide invaluable information into the exploitation of the surroundings of the site as well as into the subsistence patterns, material culture repertoires, procurement strategies and use and exchange of raw materials and tools. Additionally, the excellent preservation of organic materials offers new insights into food plants grown and harvested on-site, and then processed and consumed. The environmental challenges incited the Anse Trabaud community to adapt their settlement organisation and procurement strategies over time and underscore the importance of their participation in a regional and social network of mobility and exchange."

Thus far, the identifcation of heated non-fint rocks in archaeological contexts largely depends on a visual (macroscopic) assessment using criteria thought to be diagnostic for thermal alteration. However, visual identifcation can be subject to observer bias, and some heat-induced traces can be quite difcult to distinguish from other types of weathering or discolouration. In this paper, we present feldspar luminescence analysis as an independent, objective way to identify heated non-fint rocks and to evaluate the results against the established visual macroscopic method for the identifcation of such pieces. This is done by submitting manuported rocks with and without inferred macroscopic characteristics of heating, originating from the Last Interglacial, Middle Palaeolithic site Neumark-Nord 2/2 (Germany), to feldspar luminescence analysis (pIRIR290). Results of the feldspar luminescence analysis are compared with the visual assessments. This proof of concept study demonstrates the potential of luminescence analyses as an independent, quantitative method for the identifcation of heated rocks—and their prehistoric applications like hot-stone cooking, specifcally for cases where macroscopic assessment cannot provide reliable determinations"

Earth system models suggest that this anthropogenic land cover change influenced regional and global climate. However, the representation of past land use in earth system models is currently oversimplified. As a result, there are large uncertainties in the current understanding of the past and current state of the earth system. In order to improve representation of the variety and scale of impacts that past land use had on the earth system, a global effort is underway to aggregate and synthesize archaeological and historical evidence of land use systems. Here we present a simple, hierarchical classification of land use systems designed to be used with archaeological and historical data at a global scale and a schema of codes that identify land use practices common to a range of systems, both implemented in a geospatial database. The classification scheme and database resulted from an extensive process of consultation with researchers worldwide. Our scheme is designed to deliver consistent, empirically robust data for the improvement of land use models, while simultaneously allowing for a comparative, detailed mapping of land use relevant to the needs of historical scholars. To illustrate the benefits of the classification scheme and methods for mapping historical land use, we apply it to Mesopotamia and Arabia at 6 kya (c. 4000 BCE). The scheme will be used to describe land use by the Past Global Changes (PAGES) LandCover6k working group, an international project comprised of archaeologists, historians, geographers, paleoecologists, and modelers. Beyond this, the scheme has a wide utility for creating a common language between research and policy communities, linking archaeologists with climate modelers, biodiversity conservation workers and initiatives."

There is much discussion on the relative importance of local, regional and international exchange, the role of various groups of actors, and the nature of exchange. What is largely lacking is a consideration of non-elite rural dwellers as constitutive elements in the economy. The present study focusses on the role of rural communities in the development of exchange systems during the Carolingian period. To what extent did the consumptive preferences of rural communities influence the flow of goods at a regional and interregional level? This is examined by cataloguing the finds from Carolingian sites in the Netherlands and comparing their distributions between regions. It can be demonstrated that rural dwellers indeed played a part in developments in the production and distribution of goods. At the same time the conducted analyses do not allow the establishment of a single model of how rural dwellers participated in exchange networks of the period. In fact, this study contends that there is little meaning in determining the relative importance of different groups in society for the establishment and maintenance of exchange networks at any one time."

Rather few elements outlast extractive operations. Therefore, it is hard to visualise the precise location of unearthed finds at a previously excavated research area. Here, we present a mixed reality environment that displays in situ 3D models of features that were formerly extracted and recorded with 3D coordinates during unearthing operations. We created a tablet application that allows the user to view the position, orientation and dimensions of every recorded find while freely moving around the archaeological site with the device. To anchor the model, we used physical landmarks left at the excavation. A series of customised forms were created to show (onscreen) the different types of features by superimposing them over the terrain as perceived by the tablet camera. The application permits zooming-in, zooming-out, querying for specific artefacts and reading metadata associated with the archaeological elements. When at the office, our environment enables accurate visualisations of the 3D geometry concerning previously unearthed features and their spatial relationships. The application operates using the Swift programming language, Python scripts and ARKit technology. We present here an example of its use at Les Cottes, France, a palaeolithic site where thousands of artefacts are excavated out of six superimposed layers with a complex conformation."

Puberty is a key developmental period involving transition to physical adulthood with broad societal relevance through its impact on fertility, morbidity, and mortality.Materials and methodsIndividuals (= 55), including 27 of known sex and age‐at‐death, between the ages of 8 and 25 years were assessed for six skeletal markers indicative of pubertal growth spurt. Recent novel osteoarchaeological methods from Shapland and Lewis are used to reconstruct the timing and duration of pubertal stages.ResultsPubertal acceleration occurred earlier in females (10.38 years,= 8) than males (13.30 years,= 6), whereas maturation occurred later in males (21.36 years,= 11) than females (19.30 years,= 5). Onset appears earlier and completion later compared to other archaeological skeletal samples with osteoarchaeological evidence of puberty. Age shortly after menarche was reconstructed at 20.45 years, substantially later than historic records and bioarchaeological research reports suggest.ConclusionThis early onset and late completion caused a “stretch” of the overall duration of puberty compared to other collections, especially of the last three stages. This prolonged development is reflected in historically known social expectations for the Netherlands, for example, that marriage and children should not occur before about 22–23 years of age. Increasing the range of past peoples with puberty stage reconstruction will permit more insightful interpretations of the biological and cultural patterns of this important life stage."

However, quantitative comparisons between the surfaces of purported archaeological bone tools and experimentally manufactured and used bones are complicated by taphonomic processes affecting ancient bone. Nonetheless, it may be reasonable to assume that bones within the same deposits are altered similarly and thus these alterations are quantifiable. Here we show how unworked bones can be used to quantify the taphonomic effect on bone surfaces and how this effect can then be controlled for and incorporated into an analysis for evaluating the modified surfaces of purported bone tools. To assess the baseline taphonomy of Middle Paleolithic archaeological deposits associated with typologically identified bone artifacts, specificallylissoirs, we directly compare the surface textures of ancient and modern unworked ribs. We then compare the ancient unworked ribs andlissoirsto assess their differences and predict the ancient artifacts' original surface state using a multilevel multivariate Bayesian model. Our findings demonstrate that three of five tested surface texture parameters (Sa,Spc, andIsT) are useful for distinguishing surface type. Our model predictions show thatlissoirstend to be less rough, have more rounded surface peaks, and exhibit more directionally oriented surfaces. These characteristics are likely due to anthropogenic modifications and would have been more pronounced at deposition. Quantifying taphonomic alterations moves us one step closer to accurately assessing how bone artifacts were made and used in the ancient past."

We examined collagen values (n = 21) of carbon (δ13Cco) and nitrogen (δ15N), and enamel values (n = 81) of carbon (δ13Cen), oxygen (δ18Oen), and strontium (87Sr/86Sr) of dog remains from 16 precolumbian sites. Five comparative parameters were used to assess dietary variations between different groups: buried versus nonburied, local versus nonlocal, Greater versus Lesser Antilles, chronology, and modified versus unmodified remains. The only statistically significant difference in diets was between local and nonlocal dogs. Sufficient data were available to conduct isotopic mixing models using the FRUITS statistical program on four individuals for which depositional and morphological data were available. Results of dietary modeling indicate an unexpectedly heavy reliance on plant foods consistent with intentional feeding. This approach highlights the utility of combining isotope analysis, dietary models, morphometrics, and depositional context to provide comprehensive biographic overviews of individual animals."

An iterative, long-term experimental programme has been incorporated in the ongoing excavation of Middle Kingdom metallurgy remains at Ayn Soukhna (Egypt) in order to better understand the copper production chain at the site. The integration of archaeometry into this research methodology has enabled a detailed understanding of the geochemical changes which may occur during copper smelting in furnaces of this type. These include significant elemental fractionation, as well as important shifts in lead isotope ratios between ores and end products (slag and copper). This research presents an interpretative framework not only for understanding production waste from Ayn Soukhna itself, but more broadly the provenance and technology of copper alloys circulating in ancient Egypt. The significant shifts in lead isotope ratios observed for an experimental low-lead copper smelting system are highly relevant here, given the similar composition of many Sinai and Eastern Desert ores exploited throughout Pharaonic history. However, the implications of this research may be extrapolated beyond Egypt to low-lead copper provenance research across the ancient world and thus provide an important new methodological perspective for archaeometallurgy more generally. Furthermore, limitations to using iron in copper artefacts as a guide for their production technology are pointed out. Similar iron contents are observed for woodand charcoal-based smelting systems, inviting a reappraisal of fuel use at ancient metal production contexts in Egypt and elsewhere. A research approach integrating excavation, experimentation and analysis is essential when confronting the complexity of production chains underlying Egyptian copper artefacts. While daunting, this generates more nuanced interpretative frameworks for studying copper provenance and technology."

It is one of the few sites with deposits covering the Middle to Later Stone Age transition (~40,000–30,000 years BP) in southern Africa. Comprehending the site’s depositional history and occupation sequence is thus important for the broader understanding of the development of Homo sapiens’ behavior. The rockshelter was first excavated in the 1980s by Jonathan Kaplan. He suggested that the integrity of the late Middle Stone Age and Later Stone Age sediments was compromised by large-scale sediment movement. In 2018, we initiated a high-resolution geoarchaeological study of the site to clarify the site formation processes. Here, we present the results of the excavation and propose a revised stratigraphic division of the Pleistocene sequence based on field observations, sedimentological (particle size) analyses, and cluster analysis. The taphonomy of the site is assessed through phytolith and geochemical (pH, loss on ignition, stable carbon isotope) analyses. The results indicate a consistent sedimentological environment characterized by in situ weathering. The analysis of the piece-plotted finds demonstrates semihorizontal layering of archaeologically dense zones and more sterile ones. There was no indication of large-scale postdepositional sediment movement. We show that the low-density archaeological horizons in the upper part of the Pleistocene sequence are best explained by the changing patterns of sedimentation rate"

But the role of Johan Maurits in the transatlantic slave trade and enslavement in Brazil is poorly covered by research, with some historians recently arguing that there is ‘no proof’ of any personal involvement.

The artefacts were recovered from two of the earliest Neolithic farming communities in the central plain of China. The research focuses on addressing four research issues regarding “correlation between tool type and function”, “choices of ancient food processing techniques”, “rice processing in the early rice agricultural societies”, and “foodways in different Neolithic communities”. The findings were published in four peer-reviewed academic articles (Chapter 2 to 5). The data attained regarding Neolithic culinary practices and different uses of grinding tools allows a more nuanced and broader consideration of ancient foodways in the research region. Chapter 6 consolidates the results from the study of archaeological grinding tools and previous research to discuss the foodways of the ancient Jiahu population. In Chapter 7, a comparison of foodways at Jiahu and other Peiligang Culture sites suggests the intangible cultural boundaries and interactions between these Neolithic communities. Overall, this dissertation highlights that Neolithic grinding tools played different roles in early farming societies, especially in food processing practices."

The study of the adhesives used by Neandertals and early modern humans currently plays a significant role in debates about human technological and cognitive evolution. Depending on the type of adhesive used, different production sequences were required. These can vary in complexity and would have needed different knowledge, expertise, and resources to manufacture. However, our knowledge of this important technological development is severely hampered by poorly understood taphonomic processes, which affects the preservation and identification of adhesive materials and leads to a research bias. Here we present the results from a 3-year field preservation experiment. Flint flakes hafted and non-hafted with replica adhesives were left to weather naturally on and below the surface at two locations with different soils and climatic conditions. Differential preservation was recorded on a variety of natural adhesives by digitally measuring the surface area of each residue before and after the elapsed time. Residues were further assessed and photographed using metallographic optical microscopy. Results show that certain adhesives preserve to a significantly higher degree than others, while some materials may be more easily overlooked or visually misdiagnosed. We must therefore be aware of both taphonomic and identification biases when discussing ancient adhesive technology. This research provides a first look that will help us understand the disparities between which adhesives were used in the past and what we find in the archaeological record today."

The results of these analyses suggest the application of specific techniques in layout and construction works: the intersection of circles during the Hafit occupations, and more sophisticated techniques, combining the properties of circles and triangles, during the Umm an-Nar period.The diachronic approach allowed by the temporal span of the occupations highlights a firm progression of architectural paradigms and building crafts throughout the EBA.

The fruits of Irvingiaceae trees, commonly known as ""bush mangoes"" or ""mangues sauvages,"" are crucial foods for Central African human populations, as well as local wildlife. Irvingiaceae oil-rich kernels play an important role in local diet, well-being, and livelihood. When collected for sale, they enter the international market of non-timber forest products (NTFPs), which represents a considerable source of income for central African countries. Despite the importance of bush mangoes, there is a general lack of precision in the literature on the exact species of Irvingiaceae present in local diets and NTFP markets. Few botanical studies include local names and uses of the different Irvingiaceae species, while ethnographical and social studies rarely corroborate their identifications by collecting vouchers. In this study, we combined ethnographic research and botanical collection to verify which Irvingiaceae species were consumed and collected for trade by the Baka, a group of forager-horticulturalists in southeastern Cameroon. We provide evidence of the floristic diversity hidden behind the term ""bush mangoes"", as well as the knowledge and uses of Irvingiaceae fruits by the Baka. We discuss the importance of eight Irvingiaceae species for Baka livelihood as well as the potential threats regarding the future of these valuable trees."

Previous studies suggested a change in the original Latin population of ancient Satricum as a result of migrating groups called the Volscians coming from the eastern mountainous hinterland of Latium. The purportedly relatively short occupation of Satricum (ca. 150 years) by the Volscians during the post-Archaic period increases the chance of identifying the first generation of migrants coming from the mountains. Individuals from three presumable Volscian necropoleis in Satricum are analyzed. Forty-three third molars were sampled for isotope and elemental analyses. All individuals appear to be ""local"" based on their strontium and oxygen isotope ratios. However, three individuals have statistically lower strontium isotope ratios than the rest, two of which originate from two intersecting graves. These two also have the lowest strontium concentrations, potentially suggesting they are spatially and possibly biologically related. At the group level, the strontium concentration data show a clear difference between the necropoleis. An additional difference is in the dental non-metric trait frequencies, with a biodistance analysis suggesting the necropoleis contain different gene pools (MMD score of 0.789). It is hard to determine if these data suggest (1) a population that experienced fast and marked gene flow between use of the necropoleis, or (2) a population with large, distinct kin groups using different necropoleis. Nonetheless, the data show that the 5th to 4th century BCE was a period of change in Satricum and this work paves the way for future research as we strive to understand the origins and identities of these peoples."

Both tomb styles were designed with multiple uses in mind, filling with the remains of funerals forgotten over generations of reuse. In rare cases, the tombs were used once or seemingly not at all, cleaned thoroughly or sealed and abandoned entirely. Rather than focus on the missing or muddled record of funeral and post-funeral activities, this book re-examines Mycenaean tomb architecture and the decisions that guided it.From minimalistic to monumental, builders designed tombs with forethought to how commissioners and witnesses would react and remember them. Patterns suggest that memories of what tombs should look like heavily influenced new construction toward recurring shapes and appropriate scales. The wider debates over cost from ‘architectural energetics’ and perception in Aegean mortuary behaviour are thus revisited. Both can find common purpose in labour measured through a relative index and collective memory – how labourers and patrons saw their work. That metric for comparison lies within a median standard: in this instance, tombs expressed in terms of correlative shape and simple labour investment of the earth and rock moved to create them. This was accomplished here through photogrammetric modelling of 94 multi-use tombs in Achaea and Attica, verifying a cost-effective alternative for local authorities warding off information loss through site destruction from looting and earthquakes. Since most labour models suggest the tombs were not burdensome, commissioners held extravagant building in check by weighing the social risks and rewards of standing out from the crowd."

Standard analytical approaches to this material involves the mapping of microartefact densities to identify activity areas, and the creation of techno-typologies to characterise the form of retouch flakes from different types of tools. Whilst use-wear analysis is a common approach to the analysis of tools, it has been applied much less commonly to microdebitage. This paper contends that the use-wear analysis of microdebitage holds great potential for identifying activity areas on archaeological sites, representing a relatively unexplored analytical resource within microartefact assemblages. In order to test the range of factors that affect the identification of use-wear traces on small retouch flakes, a blind test consisting of 40 retouch flakes was conducted. The results show that wear traces can be identified with comparable levels of accuracy to those reported for historic blind tests of standard lithic tools suggesting that the use-wear analysis of retouch flakes can be a useful analytical tool in understanding site function, and in increasing sample sizes in cases where assemblages contain few tools."

Results show that the production of these hammocks occurred in an area larger than traditionally believed, and that indigenous peoples at times decorated these hammocks in such a way as to express elements of their culture, imprinting ethnic markers onto artifacts that were many times considered as non-indigenous due to their production in transcultural contexts."

Is landscape biography just a narration of a specific defined place on the face of the Earth in a defined period of time or does it have a practical output? Is it possible to help design the future of landscapes by narrating the past? These questions are explicitly addressed for a specific region in Eastern Estonia, Vooremaa (in translation: the land of drumlins). The source base for this landscape biography compiles of archaeological, cartographical, environmental, and folkloristic data.In addition, the scope of the study concentrates on historic land use around archaeological sites in Vooremaa and it aims to create a system for assessing the archaeological heritage value of certain micro-regions. One of the goals of the thesis is therefore to develop a practical methodology for detecting archaeological heritage in the landscape as well that may contribute to the (thinking about) sustainable landscape development through create concepts of heritage preservation."

We present high-resolution paleoenvironmental and archaeological data from the Last Interglacial locality of Neumark-Nord (Germany). Among the factors that shaped vegetation structure and succession in this lake landscape, we identify a distinct ecological footprint of hominin activities, including fire use. We compare these data with evidence from archaeological and baseline sites from the same region. At Neumark-Nord, notably open vegetation coincides with a virtually continuous c. 2000-year-long hominin presence, and the comparative data strongly suggest that hominins were a contributing factor. With an age of c. 125,000 years, Neumark-Nord provides an early example of a hominin role in vegetation transformation."

Agricultural weeds suggest more southern, loess-covered areas, such as are found in the German Rhineland, Belgium, and northern France, as possible sources. Besides the staple crops true luxury products were detected i.e. fig, raisin, and walnut. It turns out that the inhabitants of Oegstgeest were not just rural people living off their own territory.

The aim of this overarching project, which applies a multidisciplinary approach, is threefold: to detect in this mountain landscape the main activity areas and reconstruct possible connections between them; to analyse the long-term relationships between Trentino and Prealpine Veneto from prehistory to the present day; and to study the evolving function of this frontier area during periods of conflict/interaction. Several methods were employed to shed light on the above-mentioned research aims: field-walking survey, analysis of aerial photos, ethnographic and archival research, GIS-based landscape analysis and predictive modelling, and LiDAR data for feature detection in wooded areas. The combined use of all these approaches allowed us to identify long-term exploitation activities, which are documented also by both the ethnographic and archaeological data. The major periods of conflict in these areas are also highlighted in the archaeological record. The 2019-survey campaign opens up new research directions such as the future excavation of Bronze Age occupation zones; network and connectivity analysis between Prealpine Veneto and Trentino; hillforts and their interaction with the highlands."

For this purpose, we analyzed the prevalence of chronic maxillary sinusitis in the adult urban population of Arnhem (n = 83) and in the rural village of Middenbeemster (n = 74). A slightly higher prevalence of chronic maxillary sinusitis was observed in the Arnhem sample (55.4%) compared with the Middenbeemster sample (51.3%), and these variations were not statistically significantly different. Although historical sources attest to the fact that life in the postmedieval settlements of Arnhem and Middenbeemster greatly differed, our results suggest that both environments exposed people to certain respiratory hazards. Furthermore, sinusitis prevalence was also investigated in correlation to sex, as urbanization in the Netherlands often involved women in factory work in direct contrast to the traditional domestic role they kept covering in rural environments. No significant differences were observed between males and females, both in an intersite (Arnhem males vs. Middenbeemster males; Arnhem females vs. Middenbeemster females) and in an intrasite (males vs. females at Arnhem; males vs. females at Middenbemster) comparison. As men and women in Arnhem worked on similar tasks, our results confirm that they were both exposed to similar risk factors. In Middenbeemster, where women mainly stayed inside taking care of the house while men worked the fields, the adverse weather conditions and continuous exposure to pollens and allergens may have enhanced men's chances of contracting chronic maxillary sinusitis. This study suggests that urbanization in the early modern Netherlands was in fact not inherently more detrimental than rural living. Future research incorporating a larger sample from other Dutch sites is being considered to better frame the complex etiology of sinusitis within the present understanding of historic regional variation in urbanization patterns."

In deze periode kwam het meegeven van dierenbotten veel voor en het lijkt erop dat dit gedurende de ijzertijd nog toenam. Dierenbotten zijn gevonden in mannengraven, vrouwengraven, kindergraven en in zowel elite- als niet-elitegraven. Er lijkt gedurende de hele ijzertijd geen onderscheid te zijn gemaakt op basis van leeftijd, geslacht of status. Ook lijkt er geen relatie te zijn geweest tussen het type graf en de keuze om wel of geen dierenbotten mee te geven. Dierenbotten eindigden vermoedelijk voornamelijk in graven als onderdeel van een rituele maaltijd. Door de tijd heen zien we dat varkens daarbij steeds dominanter werden. Vanaf de midden-ijzertijd lijkt er een sterke voorkeur te hebben bestaan voor het meegegeven van varkensbotten in graven. Het dierlijk botmateriaal van het grafveld van Wijchen Woezik Sportpark voldoet op hoofdlijnen aan dit algemene patroon. Wel is de vondst van een runderstaart opmerkelijk. Een ander uitzonderlijk geval is dat van Beuningen waar rund, schaap/geit, varken, vogel, platvis, kikker en pad in één graf zijn gevonden. Mogelijk moeten we deze vreemde combinatie zien als de resten van een medicijn; een fenomeen dat we kennen uit de Romeinse tijd. In dat geval kunnen we dit bijzondere graf wellicht interpreteren als het graf van een medicijnman."

This created tension between the government of Indonesia and those countries that had lost ships in the archipelago, especially the Netherlands. A three-track cooperation agreement was set up to investigate the disappearance of the three Dutch wrecks with the aim of understanding what had happened, in order to create a better basis for cooperation in the future. The management and protection of shipwrecks from WWII is very complicated, because of the different values that stakeholders attach to them. Only with the proper understanding and consideration of the different values or significance WWII shipwrecks hold for different stakeholders can new ways of managing these complex sites be developed that have long-term effectiveness.

There, pastoral practises began during the Late Neolithic (2300 BC), but alpine dairy farming was directly evidenced so far only since the Late Bronze Age/Early Iron Age (1300–500 BC). The vegetation development, timberline shifts at 2280 m a.s.l. and environmental conditions of the subalpine Urschai Valley (Canton of Grisons, Switzerland) were reconstructed for the small (8 m2) Plan da Mattun fen based on palynological and geochemical analyses for the last six millennia. The X-ray fluorescence (XRF) analyses are among the first ones performed on a European peatland in such altitudes. A high Rb/Sr ratio in the fen peat sediments revealed an increase in catchment erosion during the time when the forests of the Upper Urschai Valley were steadily diminished probably by fire and livestock impact (2300–1700 BC). These landscape openings were paralleled by increasing micro-charcoal influx values, suggesting that prehistoric people actively set fire on purpose. Simultaneously, palynological evidence for pastoralism was revealed, such as pollen from typical herbs indicating livestock trampling, and abundant spores from coprophilous fungi. Since then, vertical transhumance and pastoral activities remained responsible for the open subalpine landscape above 2000 m a.s.l., most probably also in the context of milk and dairy production since 1300 BC, which is characteristic for the European Alps until today."

Here, we focus on ornaments from five recently excavated sites in the Dominican Republic (AD 800–1600). We used microwear analysis to investigate each ornament and assess its production sequence and use life. These data permitted the definition of morpho-technical groups, which we then compared to depositional contexts and the regional availability of raw materials. We demonstrate that (1) there was small-scale production of ornaments at the sites, (2) the most recurrent morpho-technical groups were likely imported from production centers, and (3) ornaments of the same group could lead different use lives and be deposited through varied processes. We conclude that bodily ornaments had highly diverse biographies involving local and regional interaction networks."

Very early in the period of settlement Sandy Point rose in prominence over the island's other towns as a major port with a strategically vital anchorage. The defence of this anchorage and the approaches to it were the responsibility of Charles Fort and Brimstone Hill Fortress. The proximity of Sandy Point to the island of St. Eustatius, positioned the port ideally to become a nexus of trade, including illicit trade, between the English and Dutch West Indies. Even after the decline of this port's strategic importance to Britain from the mid nineteenth century onwards, it continued to play a vital role in trade and communications between the British and Dutch Atlantic Worlds. The reasons for, and the pattern of ascendancy and decline of one of the first major West Indian ports in the Atlantic World is explored in this dissertation, as well as the influence of this port on the development of the early Atlantic World System.

The church is a three-nave basilica that most probably was built in the fifth century CE. In later expansion phases, it was remodeled by the addition of two side chapels and several rooms. The research investigated the physical, mineralogical, and isotopic properties of twenty-four marble samples of different functions using naked eyes, lenses, and multiple analytical techniques including optical microscopy, mass spectrometry, and X-ray diffraction. The results showed that the architectural elements were made of the gray calcitic Proconnesus-1 marble (Marmara, Turkey); while the four fonts or basins were carved out of the beige dolomitic Thasos-3 marble (Thasos Island, Cape Vathy, Greece); and the small squared column of unknown function was carved out of the fine-grained white calcitic Penteli marble (Mount Pentelikon, Attica, Greece).The results indicate that the most popular supply of the ecclesial marble to the south (and north) Jordan during the Byzantine period was the gray Proconnesus-1. The use of white Penteli and Thasos-3 marbles were limited to ritual elements."

The approach to this dataset reveals the ways people interacted with edible plants in southern Central America. The scarcity of griddles recovered from ancient Nicaraguan archeological contexts has previously co-determined narratives on human mobility or cultural influence from the Mesoamerican culture area, due to the debatable presumption that this type of artifact necessarily entangles production and consumption of maize. In this article, we present results demonstrating evidence for the use of several starchy plants. The reconstructed culinary practices are vital for disentangling human–plant interrelationships and challenge earlier conceptions of ancient foodways in Central America. This research constitutes the first starch analysis in Nicaragua and the recovered plant remains belonging to manioc (Crantz), chili pepper (sp.), and maize (L.) have provided empirical evidence of ancient foodways. Concomitantly, these results have invalidated the preconception that griddles were tools used exclusively for the production of maize."

Concentrations and sizes of phytoliths in the wear test media match those of silica particles. Cusp geometries and ensuing abrasion volumes are measured by digital profilometry.

Using the palynological record from the large lake Neumark-Nord 1 (NN1) and the adjacent small “pool” Neumark-Nord 2 (NN2) a sequence of lithic and faunal assemblages has been established, indicating Neanderthal presence in the lakeland throughout the Eemian. Calculations of the herbivore carrying capacity for the Neumark area during the Eemian reveal high biomass estimates. Using these estimates it was possible to calculate the structure of the source population, based on the faunal record rich in species and individuals, from littoral deposits assigned to the first mesocratic phase of the Eemian. The results can be used as a frame of reference for making inferences on subsistence opportunities and prey selection based on taphonomical and zooarchaeological studies of the Neumark-Nord faunal assemblages. In a broader perspective our study demonstrates the benefits from inferring energy values (kcal) and body mass (kg) as ancillary parameters to zooarchaeological analyses to understand the relationships between death assemblage and their habitats from which they originate."

Jones et al. (1994) provide a substantial list of animals and even plants. A clear example is dam-building by beavers. But humans have gone to greater lengths and all ‘improvements’ are still valued today.

Nevertheless, antimony minerals were an important resource for several millennia, used in metallurgy and to opacify or decolour glass and glazes. In this way, Sb spread throughout the known world from the Chalcolithic onward. In glassmaking, stibnite was the only available resource that could provide in any measure the very pure Sb evident from trace element analyses of the earliest glass. Sb isotopic analysis has allowed Late Bronze Age Egyptian and Mesopotamian glass vessels and Caucasian Sb metallic beads to be compared to the possible ancient ore sources. The only known matches for the isotopic composition of the glass are stibnite ores from the Racha-Lechkumi district in the Caucasus (present-day Georgia), near the Zopkhito Au-Sb deposits, mined from the 17th century BCE. Conversely, the Sb metal beads represent several isotopic and trace element compositional groups, only one of which matches the Racha-Lechkumi stibnite. Sb extraction for glassmaking was likely unrelated to copper metallurgy, and may have been associated with the mining of precious metals."

It appears that, between the Antiquity and the Modern period, the white kaolinitic material has always been exploited. The main technical changes between the Merovingian and the Carolingian periods are related to the specific selection of these clays that allow to produce white pottery and cooking wares with few inclusions. The Carolingian workshops used the material available in their environment that can be differentiated by chemistry and mineralogy. Finally, it appears that the selection of this particular type of clay also oriented the choice of the place where the potters settled or at least the longevity of some of the workshops."

The research considers the role of landscape or place (the spatial location of a community’s cultural identity) to sustainable heritage protection, given that these islands are former British colonies and their perceived ‘placelessness’ facilitated the destruction of land and the attendant community relationships essential for heritage, with the conversion to private property through the law.The research question considers the degree to which modern heritage law is spatially just (responsive to the needs of local communities) given this colonial legacy. The research findings indicate that while international law has pivoted away from colonialist approaches to indigenous and local communities and their relationships with heritage resources (now centering them in the effective functioning of the landscape) domestic laws in the Lesser Antilles have not. Decolonisation of the current legislative framework thus requires the incorporation of landscape protection in the law. Procedural environmental rights such as access to environmental information and public participation in environmental decision-making offer a solution, because they can equip communities with the tools to contest landscape use where community cohesion is threatened, ultimately protecting heritage bearers and their practices."

Both tomb styles were designed with multiple uses in mind, filling with the remains of funerals forgotten over generations of reuse. In rare cases, the tombs were used once or seemingly not at all, cleaned thoroughly or sealed and abandoned entirely. Rather than focus on the missing or muddled record of funeral and post-funeral activities, this book re-examines Mycenaean tomb architecture and the decisions that guided it. From minimalistic to monumental, builders designed tombs with forethought to how commissioners and witnesses would react and remember them. Patterns suggest that memories of what tombs should look like heavily influenced new construction toward recurring shapes and appropriate scales. The wider debates over cost from ‘architectural energetics’ and perception in Aegean mortuary behaviour are thus revisited. Both can find common purpose in labour measured through a relative index and collective memory—how labourers and patrons saw their work. That metric for comparison lies within a median standard: in this instance, tombs expressed in terms of correlative shape and simple labour investment of the earth and rock moved to create them."

Combining reflectorless total station line-drawing with photogrammetry produces high-quality three-dimensional models of the targets which can subsequently be analysed to derive volumetric data of the employed building materials and the sizes of the individual elements. The case studies compare how different variations and combinations of three-dimensional architectural documentation can be used to create sufficiently accurate models for architectural energetics studies with varying degrees of time and expense in the field and in the post-processing phase of the research. The documentation method has been developed by the first author of this paper and disseminated through annual fieldschools conducted on archaeological sites. The standard documentation procedure is to establish ground control points and an alternative based on inbuilt instrument GPS systems is also discussed.

As a new perspective on health policy, it lacks sufficient engagement with justice. A moral right to health is proposed as a means to instill justice in One Health thought and practice. This act itself prompts a reevaluation of such a moral right from both an ecological and interspecies perspective. The thesis follows up on the Great Ape Project (GAP) by setting off from human rights as well as highlighting morally relevant similarities shared amongst human and non-human primates, to then question inherent anthropocentrism. The right to health complements the set of basic negative rights defended by GAP. It does so by developing an interest-based theory of moral rights in line with the work of Alasdair Cochrane, albeit (1) critical of his denial of animal freedom, and (2) more elaborate on the right to health. These rights are brought to bear on the various interfaces between human and non-human great apes, using One Health as a framework for integrating apparently disconnected practices, so as to work towards an interspecies health policy."

To investigate its practical value, a large, random test dataset—next to a small, non-random dataset—was developed, which better represents the real-world situation of scarce archaeological objects in different types of complex terrain. To reduce the number of false positives caused by specific regions in the research area, a novel approach has been developed and implemented called Location-Based Ranking. Experiments show that WODAN2.0 has a performance of circa 70% for barrows and Celtic fields on the small, non-random testing dataset, while the performance on the large, random testing dataset is lower: circa 50% for barrows, circa 46% for Celtic fields, and circa 18% for charcoal kilns.

The results from the microwear and residue analyses both suggest that cereals were the primary plant material processed with the grinding tools. Other plants, including acorns and underground storage organs, were also processed, but probably to a smaller extent. Furthermore, microwear analysis suggests that the dry-grinding technique was adopted for cereal processing, and a piece of hide or animal skin was placed underneath the grinding slabs to gather the processed plant material. Apart from plant food processing, one of the grinding tools was also involved in processing bone. These data put more insights into the Neolithic culinary practices and different uses of grinding tools in this region."

Reflecting on a new book on this theme, attention is given to the question what we actually mean by stating that 'things have agency'. Is this a useful subject at all, and if so, how could it be studied?"

Developers of video games are keen to make use of a variety of historical pasts as this provides them with recognisable themes,settings or narrative frameworks. Video games can be seen as the manifestation of experiential learning theory: they provide a unique informal learningenvironment in which their interactive nature allows for an immersive experience with which a deeper level of personal and historical learning can potentially be reached than in more formal settings. However, pasts incorporated in video games are mostly utilised to provide a fun experience in order to generate revenue. As more and more people depend on video games to teach them about the past, they often take the history presented in them for granted, relying on developers to tell an accurate story. Unmediated, players are prone to miss opportunities for critical engagement with the presented past, and can fall into the trap of presentism.It is important for those teaching about the past to understand how video games work, and what their potential and impact are. Data-driven approaches allow us to explore what types of games are considered to be ‘historical’. Our research shows that 206 million copies of games have been sold through Steam that were tagged as historical, and can be classified as strategy/top-down games, action-adventure narrative-driven games, or first-person action games. These types all have a reliance on some form of violence as central game mechanic, which needs to be taken into account when using video games as an education platform.Through four case studies, we show that video games can function as a platform to teach about the past in a critical, yet fun way. Firstly, Twine can be used to stimulate critical and multi-linear thinking as it allows the user to create a narrative based on a branching structure instead of a linear one. Secondly, video games can be incorporated into formal classroom settings in order to illustrate certain complex theoretical concepts. Streaming, or creating videos about games that incorporate the past, can be a major avenue for content-focused teaching, as well as a way to reflect on video game pasts – the third case study. Lastly, our RoMeincraft case study shows that participants are not only taught something about Roman heritage but also able to increase their skills in communication and digital media.

The results from the microwear and residue analyses both suggest that cereals were the primary plant material processed with the grinding tools. Other plants, including acorns and underground storage organs, were also processed, but probably to a smaller extent. Furthermore, microwear analysis suggests that the dry-grinding technique was adopted for cereal processing, and a piece of hide or animal skin was placed underneath the grinding slabs to gather the processed plant material. Apart from plant food processing, one of the grinding tools was also involved in processing bone. These data put more insights into the Neolithic culinary practices and different uses of grinding tools in this region."

Arguments for an anthropogenic origin centre around (1) their regional and temporal distribution, (2) their spatial distribution within archaeological sites, (3) their charcoal spectrum and (4) the presence of cultural remains in the pits. We argue that the absence of fire-related features and apparent discrepancies in dating can be attributed to site-formation and taphonomic processes. Finally, we indicate that, due to a lack of actual observations of the subsurface morphology of burned ant nests, it is impossible to make a valid comparison. Based on the existing literature on ant nests fires, we come to a different model of this morphology than do Crombé and Langohr (2020). We conclude that these pit hearths form an important component of the Mesolithic archaeological record and that new research into their formation and their use may shed more light on their origin and purpose."

Where since the implementation of the Valetta Treaty most excavations are aimed at ex-situ preservation of archaeological sites threatened by building activities, the site that was under investigation in 2013 and 2014 found itself in a nature reserve. As nature reserves are aimed at the very purpose of preservation, why then investigate an archaeological site that could easily profit from such a protected status? The recent access to high resolution LIDAR data for the entire surface of the present day Netherlands is only just beginning to reveal the richness of archaeological sites hidden beneath the foliage and undergrowth of the forests and heaths crammed in between the vast field systems of the Dutch countryside. From late prehistoric barrow landscapes and celtic fields to Medieval cart tracks, all these features still find themselves at the very surface in these nature reserves. These sites of various age can provide a unique glimpse into the past but their location at the very surface also makes these sites vulnerable and, as is becoming more clear in recent years, are threatened by nature itself. Tree roots, burrowing animals and ongoing podzolization are all examples of natural processes that gradually obscure these sites from sight. To map both the state as well as the research potential of such an archaeological ‘palimpsest’ an archaeological field experiment was carried out in one of the largest nature reserves of the Netherlands at a site called ‘Apeldoorn – Uddeler Heegde’. This article reports on the most important new insights of the fieldwork in the form of a landscape biography."

To guide this search task, NER is needed. We created rigorous annotation guidelines in an iterative process, then instructed five archaeology students to annotate a number of documents. The resulting dataset contains ~31k annotations between six entity types (artefact, time period, place, context, species & material). The inter-annotator agreement is 0.95, and when we used this data for machine learning, we observed an increase in F1 score from 0.51 to 0.70 in comparison to a machine learning model trained on a dataset created in prior work. This indicates that the data is of high quality, and can confidently be used to train NER classifiers"

A particular choice for this study was the largest and arguably most significant archaeological site in the area, Aguas Buenas (cal 4001250 CE), a pre-Hispanic indigenous agglomeration consisting of 371 human-made mounds of various shapes arranged in geometric patterns. Microanalytical approaches were applied to reconstruct the use of raw mineral resources in the production of ubiquitous pottery materials found at this site and in its immediate surroundings. The resulting compositional analysis produced geochemical and mineralogical data allowing for the characterisation of distinct, geologically-based compositional groups throughout the valley, improving on the limited geological data resolution previously available. The integrated microscopic and compositional analysis (through p-XRF) of archaeological pottery materials and raw clay samples, generates a number of hypotheses and insights about the nature of the Aguas Buenas site, and its role as a shared space amongst groups living in the Mayales river Subbasin. Additionally, this study provides a solid research framework of investigation that can be employed for more detailed and extensive future studies on pre-Hispanic human occupation in this research area or elsewhere."

At first sight, the mountainous uplands and the desert fringe of North Africa seem to be such an area of resistance: in the Late Roman and Byzantine period, the Atlas Mountains and the Tripolitanian Sahara were epicentres of indigenous revolt against the Roman state, particularly during the Moorish Wars c. 533-548 AD. The question is whether the physical geography truly determined a cultural antagonism between inland zones and the Mediterranean coast. Using evidence from survey archaeology, epigraphy and literary sources, this paper tests models on connectivity and resistance, disputing the simple opposition between an inland, indigenous world on the one hand, and a cosmopolitan , Mediterranean and Roman world on the other. Instead, evidence shows that the relationship between ""Roman"" and ""native"" was much more complex, entangled and ambivalent, despite the peripheral nature of the inland landscapes. The cultural landscape was determined as much by historical factors as environmental."

It is composed of four articles published in peer-reviewed journals. The first half proposes a research strategy for studying circum-Caribbean collections, which are markedly diverse in their origins, raw materials, and preservation state. Furthermore, an ethnographic museum collection, including whole necklaces, is studied as basis for interpretation. In the second part, collections from two time periods are studied: 1) the early part of the Early Ceramic Age in the eastern Caribbean; and 2) the Late Ceramic Age in the Greater Antilles. In each case-study, the presence of technical products and use-wear are combined to elucidate exchange patterns. This approach contributes toward a new assessment of large-scale interactions and the social mechanisms responsible for them.

Methodological tests were carried out on a selection of archaeological bones spanning the breadth of the radiocarbon method at varying levels of preservation. Our standard pretreatment protocol for ~500 mg bone was refined for <100 mg bone. Collagen extracted from solid pieces of bone (rather than powdered bone) and a reduced duration of the gelatinisation stage improved collagen yields for small samples. The quality of the extracted collagen was evaluated based on the yield, elemental and stable isotopic values and the obtained 14C measurements."

The book analyses the costs and benefits of the fort’s World Heritage recognition to its local urban community and to the colonial fort itself, as a monument. It shows how thirty years of the World Heritage project at Galle Fort changed a once small seaside walled town with dilapidated colonial buildings into a tourist hot-spot and prime real estate, also changing the lives of its inhabitants. The work addresses the range of impacts of this process such as gentrification, real estate pressures, and urban regeneration in a balanced way. It argues that the best practises of participatory and people-centred approaches of managing urban heritage at the global level are slow to progress at the local level. While seeing the World Heritage listing of Galle Fort optimistically, the book encourages the use of the World Heritage emblem for the well-being of local residents, who bring life to these landscapes."

Materials and Methods We carried out lead (Pb) isotope analyses on dental enamel samples from 24 individuals from the Newton Plantation Cemetery in Barbados, which had previously been analyzed for strontium (Sr) and oxygen (O) isotope composition (Schroeder et al., American Journal of Physical Anthropology, 2009, 139:547-557) and Pb concentrations (Schroeder et al., American Journal of Physical Anthropology, 2013, 150:203-209. Results We are able to identify British Pb sources, and more specifically Bristol/Mendips Pb, as the most likely source of anthropogenic Pb on the plantation, highlighting the impact of the British Atlantic economy on the lives of enslaved peoples in Barbados during the period of plantation slavery. Furthermore, we find that there is only one clear outlier among seven individuals who had previously been identified as African-born based on their enamel Sr isotope composition (Schroeder et al., American Journal of Physical Anthropology, 2009, 139:547-557). All other individuals present a very homogenous Pb isotope composition, which overlaps with that of British Pb sources. Conclusion Our results indicate that while Pb isotope analyses can help identify and further characterize the sources of anthropogenic Pb in plantation settings, they might not be suited for identifying the origins of African-born individuals in diasporic contexts."

One of the earliest changes was the introduction of new plant and animal foods and culinary traditions. This study presents the first archaeological reconstruction of indigenous diets and foodways in the Caribbean spanning the historical divide of 1492. We use multiple isotope datasets to reconstruct these diets and investigate the potential relationships between dietary and mobility patterns at multiple scales. Dietary patterns are assessed by isotope analyses of different skeletal elements from the archaeological skeletal population of El Chorro de Maita, Cuba. This approach integrates carbon and nitrogen isotope analyses of bone and dentine collagen with carbon and oxygen isotope analyses of bone and enamel apatite. The isotope results document extreme intrapopulation dietary heterogeneity but few systematic differences in diet between demographic/social groups. Comparisons with published isotope data from other precolonial and colonial period populations in the Caribbean indicate distinct dietary and subsistence practices at El Chorro de Maita. The majority of the local population consumed more animal protein resources than other indigenous populations in the Caribbean, and their overall dietary patterns are more similar to colonial period enslaved populations than to indigenous ones."

This article contributes to our knowledge on this subject through the analysis of a female individual buried in Pietermaai, an 18th century suburb of Willemstad. Excavated in the 1980s by the Archaeological-Anthropological Institute of the Netherlands Antilles, the remains are only now attracting osteological attention. Isotopic analysis has shown that this individual spent her childhood in West Africa, supporting morphological and metric analyses identifying her African ancestry. At the time of death, she had an adult chronological age (over 18 years), but her physical development indicated a non-adult biological age (possibly between 12 and 15 years). Such delayed development can occur due to many factors, including hard labour and disease. In the case of this individual, evidence such as enamel hypoplasia, osteochondritis dissecans, and periostitis may indicate stressful episodes throughout the life course. Clearly defined entheses and entheseal changes at muscle attachment sites on the arms and legs may indicate a physically demanding occupation. A variety of factors could therefore have contributed to her developmental delay. In the future, further analysis of buried populations in Curacao will help to increase our understanding of the lifeways of enslaved people here. Meanwhile, the analysis of this isolated individual is important because it situates enslavement in a real body and indicates the value of reanalysis of human remains from existing archaeological collections in the Caribbean."

This has generally been interpreted as the production of black pigment that may have been applied to the body as a form of symbolic expression. However, Heyes and colleagues (2016) demonstrate that MnO2 can reduce the auto-ignition temperature of wood by upwards of 100°C and suggest that this special pyrotechnic property of powdered MnO2 may have been appreciated by Neandertals. Specifically, they suggest that the addition of MnO2 to tinder materials may have aided in fire-making. The purpose of the pilot study described here is to test the utility of MnO2 as a tinder enhancer during actualistic fire-making experiments. The flint-and-pyrite fire-making method was employed to produce sparks that were directed onto fluffed tinder fungus (Fomes fomentarius) with and without added MnO2 to determine if and the degree to which this material improves the ability of the tinder to capture and propagate sparks into a glowing ember. The results of this pilot study lend support to the hypothesis of Heyes and colleagues by demonstrating that MnO2 improves the spark capturing efficiency of tinder material over untreated tinder, thereby reducing the time and energy required to produce fire using the percussive fire-making method. However, it was also observed that the incorporation of pyrite (FeS2 ) dust into the untreated tinder over the course of the experiments appeared to improve its ability to capture sparks, lending to the idea that pyrite powder added to tinder prior to making fire could also expedite the process and largely negates the need for collecting MnO2 for this purpose."

The results show that glass corrosion in soil not only depends on acidity, alkalinity or glass composition but also on the texture of the soil, measurable as grain-size distribution, and the mineralogical composition.

The extensive jewellery on the figurines contains large fibulae appliques fastening pectoral chains with several sorts of pendants.

The block shaped, sloping upper body might have originated with aniconic objects, but suggests here a seated person. An archaeological experiment on figurine production and a detailed material analysis proved most of the figurines studied to have been designed and produced locally. Moulds of wooden figurines were used in the production of the moulds. Exchange with Selinous resulted in variations of the standard and figurines with finely detailed faces. Designing and dedicating these votive figurines, and possibly also jewellery, to a cult statue might have acted as a unifying element for the multi-ethnic society of Akragas. By means of these anthropomorphic female figurines, portrayed after women, people could express their traditions and wishes using old and new symbols such as the Phoenician crescent and the Greek satyr. Their cultural influences formed a new religious setting and were placed in the newly prosperous context, helping to forge a new identity unique to Akragas."

It engages with the challenging topic of portable X-ray Florescence Spectrometry use in archaeology, especially as applied to corroded copper-alloy artefacts. The relevance is twofold. Firstly it helps us better understand the globalising effects of the Roman Empire on distant cultures and the emergence of the western economy after the end of antiquity. This is investigated by detecting changes in craft production, considered a proxy for understanding changes in past economies and societies. Secondly it advances a methodology for the study of copper-alloy objects. Subsequently the composition of Roman brooches from Germania Inferior, suggested a strong link between brass and Roman military production. This connection was also seen in other parts of the Roman world, suggesting a degree of centralisation or control. The earliest roman objects found in the Baltic States, far north of the Limes frontier, are also in this 'Roman' alloy. These objects had a lasting impact on the peoples of this region. They adopted and adapted them stylistically to suit their local preferences for centuries after they first appeared."

However, stone tool production is just one of many skills that were important for forager survival and success in the past, of which hunting strategies are one of the few documented in the Palaeolithic record. This chapter focuses on hunting skills, as a supplement to lithic studies addressing learning processes in Neanderthals and anatomically modern humans. Based on the ethnographic record, the content to be learned while hunting includes a wide range of different sorts of skills and information, some of which are situation specific. The similarities and relatively subtle differences in the record for hunting behaviour between the Middle and Upper Palaeolithic make it unlikely that there was a substantial contrast in the content to be learned or processes involved in acquiring hunting skills. Among contemporary hunters, various older individuals undertake some teaching and also frequently provide small tools, take children on hunting trips, and tell hunting stories. Children enthusiastically engage in their own hunting exploits and games with weapons. The widespread distribution of such activities suggests benefits for the speed and quality of learning, among other factors. It is not unlikely that AMH and Neanderthals, for whom hunting was an important skill, also employed some of these processes."

Starting from the observation that Neanderthal populations already were small before the arrival of modern humans, the models implement three factors that conservation biology identifies as critical for a small population’s persistence, namely inbreeding, Allee effects and stochasticity. Our results indicate that the disappearance of Neanderthals might have resided in the smallness of their population(s) alone: even if they had been identical to modern humans in their cognitive, social and cultural traits, and even in the absence of inter-specific competition, Neanderthals faced a considerable risk of extinction. Furthermore, we suggest that if modern humans contributed to the demise of Neanderthals, that contribution might have had nothing to do with resource competition, but rather with how the incoming populations geographically restructured the resident populations, in a way that reinforced Allee effects, and the effects of inbreeding and stochasticity."

Starch analysis is an exemplary method for reconstructing human–plant dependencies.

Moreover, there has been no comparison of culinary practices between The Bahama archipelago and the Greater Antilles (the presumed origin of foodways transported to The Bahama archipelago). The paper investigates 60 bivalve shell artefacts for starch remains, which were recovered from three archaeological sites: El Flaco and La Luperona (Dominican Republic), and Palmetto Junction (Turks & Caicos Islands). In contrast to ethnohistorical narratives that characterize shell tools exclusively as manioc peelers, the starch remains recovered in this study suggest a broader suite of plants and functions. The results provide evidence that a diversity of plants (spp.,L., Fabaceae,L.,Crantz, cf.L., cf.O. F. Cook, and Zingiberales) were prepared with these shells. This new evidence contributes to ongoing discussions about culinary practices in the Caribbean and other related late precolonial (.800–1500 ce) foodways."

To this end, indigenous South American narratives have been analysed, serving as a framework in order to investigate the imagery on display. It is with reason that we humans tell stories from the very moment we are able to speak: storytelling is a strategy through which we make sense of the world around us. In addition, narratives are a means to share and transmit knowledge. They therefore themselves provide information not only on the people that tell them but also on how they perceive the world. Caribbean archaeologists aim to understand past Caribbean cultures by means of their material culture, in the broadest sense. We seek to reconstruct political and social structures, belief systems and the everyday lives of communities. The focal point of the archaeological study presented here is the Saladoid zoomorphic iconography, in particular ceramic modelled and incised animal/human figurines or head lugs (adorno).

Their form bears strong similarities to those found much further south in Germania and the northern Roman provinces, leading to the conclusion that they originally arrived as imports, perhaps by sea from an as yet undiscovered production centre in an area formerly known as East Prussia. In contrast, the eye brooches found within the Germanic areas, north of the Roman frontier, are thought to have originated as export goods produced within the Roman provinces, some distance from the areas in which they are found. Therefore we re-examine the debate surrounding local production versus foreign imports, through an innovative use of pXRF. The study compares compositional data of both imported and locally produced brooches against the current typological framework with the aim to better understand how, where and when they were made."

With a new game released on an annual basis-each full of distinct historical places, events, and people-the series has unfolded across post-classical history, from the Levant during the Third Crusade to Victorian-era London. The 2017 release of Assassin's Creed: Origins, which entailed a massive reconstruction of Hellenistic Egypt, pushed the series even further back in time. With it, Ubisoft also launched its Discovery Tour, allowing players to explore the game's setting at their leisure and without combat. These trends continued in 2018's Assassin's Creed: Odyssey, set in Greece during the Peloponnesian War. This review discusses the narrative, world, and gameplay of the latest Assassin's Creed within the series more broadly. We provide a critical appraisal of the experience that Odyssey offers and link it to this question: in the Assassin's Creed series, do we engage in meaningful play with the past, or are we simply assassinating our way through history?"

Here, we present a general framework in which we combine exponential random graph models with archaeological substantiations of mechanisms that may be responsible for network formation. This framework may be applied to infer the structure of ancient networks in a large variety of archaeological settings. We use data collected over a set of sites in the Caribbean during the period AD 100–400 to illustrate the steps to obtain a network reconstruction."

The objective of our study was to analyze microbotanical residues (starches) extracted from 45 clay griddles (food preparation platters) to illuminate a partial view of the phytocultural repertoire of this region and explicate variations of the identified culinary practices. The griddles were excavated from three archaeological sites: El Flaco and La Luperona in northwestern Dominican Republic and Palmetto Junction on the western coast of Providenciales, Turks & Caicos Islands. Regarding the production of plant-based food on griddles, our produced data suggests that the people who lived at El Flaco focused on the production of maize (L.) derivatives, La Luperona residents prepared guáyiga/coontie/zamia (spp.) food products, and Palmetto Junction ostensibly had a focus on the production of manioc (Crantz) based foods. This survey of foodways has exposed particular cultural niches, different adaptation strategies, and associated culinary practices."

Not much is known about this transition and the experimental materials which would inevitably have been connected to such technological change. In this paper we present a unique snapshot of developments in glass technology in Anatolia during the Middle Iron Age, when glass is still a relatively rare commodity. The present work focusses on black glass beads decorated with yellow trails from eighth to seventh century BCE Sardis, glass beads that are very rare for this period, and on this site. A full elemental analysis of the beads was made, and Sr, Pb and B isotope ratios were determined. This study reveals the use of a combination of a previously unknown source of silica and of mineral soda, giving rise to elevated (granite-like) Sr isotope signatures, as well as high alumina and B concentrations. The yellow trails of glass on the beads consist of lead-tin yellow type II, lead stannate, showing the earliest occurrence of this type of opacifier/colourant so far, predating any other findings by at least four centuries. The production of these glass beads may be local to Sardis and experimental in nature. It is therefore suggested that Sardis may have played its role in the technological development of the glass craft during the Iron Age."

Most would agree that the bulk of dietary calories obtained by taxa such as Australopithecus and Paranthropus came from the consumption of vegetation growing across these landscapes. It is also likely that many early hominins were selective feeders that consumed particular plants/plant parts (e.g., leaves, fruit, storage organs) depending on the habitat and season within which they were foraging. Thus, improving our understanding of how the nutritional properties of potential hominin plant foods growing in modern African savanna ecosystems respond to season and vary by habitat will improve our ability to model early hominin dietary behavior. Here, we present nutritional analyses (crude protein and acid detergent fiber) of plants growing in eastern and southern African savanna habitats across both wet and dry seasons. We find that many assumptions about savanna vegetation are warranted. For instance, plants growing in our woodland habitats have higher average protein/fiber ratios than those growing in our wetland and grassland transects. However, we find that the effects of season and habitat are complex, an example being the unexpectedly higher protein levels we observe in the grasses and sedges growing in our Amboseli wetlands during the dry season. Also, we find significant differences between the vegetation growing in our eastern and southern African field sites, particularly among plants using the C4 photosynthetic pathway. This may have implications for the differences we see between the stable carbon isotope compositions and dental microwear patterns of eastern and southern African Paranthropus species, despite their shared, highly derived craniodental anatomy."

This led to several claimed differences that needed rigorous re-evaluated, by investigating larger groups of specimens, both dogs and wolves, and more importantly, and if possible, Pleistocene wolves and the oldest archaeological dogs.We re-evaluated all important morphological and morphometric criteria published in the literature. Most are related to oral, mandibular and skull differences, but also difference in stature was reported. From all criteria we re-tested very few proved to be valuable. And those that show a difference, can often only be used to a limited extend, as only the extremes of these criteria are non-overlapping between groups."

Despite the deeply divergent mitochondrial lineage present in the former individual, both Neandertals are genetically closer to later Neandertals from Europe than to a roughly contemporaneous individual from Siberia. That the Hohlenstein-Stadel and Scladina individuals lived around the time of their most recent common ancestor with later Neandertals suggests that all later Neandertals trace at least part of their ancestry back to these early European Neandertals."

Ancient DNA analyses demonstrate that migrations played a crucial role in this event. However, these analyses approach the issue at a supra-regional scale, leaving questions about the regional and local impact of this event unresolved. This study pilots an approach to ceramics that brings this small-scale impact into focus by using the transmission of ceramic technology as a proxy for social change. It draws on ethno-archaeological studies of the effects of social changes on the transmission of ceramic production techniques to hypothesise the impact of three idealised scenarios that archaeologists have proposed for the introduction of Corded Ware Culture: migration, diffusion, and network interactions. Subsequently, it verifies these hypotheses by integrating geochemical (WDXRF), mineralogical (petrography), and macromorphological analysis of ceramics with network analysis. This method is applied to 30 Late Neolithic ceramic vessels from three sites in the western coastal area of the Netherlands (Hazerswoude-Rijndijk N11, Zandwerven, and Voorschoten-De Donk). This study concludes that the introduction of Corded Ware material culture is a process that varies from site to site in the western coastal area of the Netherlands. Moreover, the introduction of the Corded Ware Culture is characterised by continuity in technological traditions throughout the study area, indicating a degree of social continuity despite typological changes in ceramics."

Model parameter values are assigned and varied automatically while optimizing the match with Neanderthal archaeology using a Genetic Algorithm (GA) inspired by the processes of natural selection. The system is able to traverse the huge parameter space that is created by the complete set of all possible parameter value combinations to find those values that will result in a simulation that matches well with archaeological data in the form of radiometrically obtained presence data.

Plumbate is linked stylistically to the Toltec culture but was produced in workshops in Soconusco (Chiapas). The discovery of a similar collection of sherds during recent work at the site of El Palacio (Zacapu, Michoacán) shows that Plumbate ware also reached this region of Western Mexico. We carried out instrumental neutron activation analyses (INAA) on 11 of the Zacapu fragments and compared the results to the data from ceramic pastes from the region of Soconusco and Pátzcuaro Basin (Michoacán). Ten sherds were produced in Michoacán and are thus a local imitation, whereas the last fragment corresponds to a Tohil-type Plumbate paste and was transported over a long distance. This raises questions of the modalities for the circulation of this pot and the conditions allowing for production of an imitation (transfer of technical know-how?), which we suggest is linked to the Toltec culture in the center of Mexico."

With some laudable exceptions, most of the excavations that expanded these collections did not follow the archaeological practice standards of our time and did not leave behind any written reports. In consequence, these objects and associated data have remained disconnected from subsequent advances in regional archaeology. In this paper, we provide a general overview of the diverse archaeological collections from the region under study and insert them, critically, into the current understanding of north-central Venezuelan archaeology. We go on to focus on body adornments in order to show how microwear analysis of their production, along with the use wear traces they exhibit, combined with data concerning raw material procurement and depositional contexts, can shed light on the intricacies of the social life of these objects.

The stage‐based method is derived from degrees of dental wear in known‐age (= 39) and estimated‐age (= 11) nonadults containing 951 teeth from the predominately 19th century cemetery of Middenbeemster, The Netherlands. The need for such a method is warranted in cases where dental development and/or eruption cannot be assessed for age‐at‐death estimation. As well, by establishing a baseline for normal age‐related nonadult tooth wear, users may better document wear that could be due to extramasticatory behaviours. The regression analysis reveals a strong quadratic correlation—(2, 47) = 555.1,< .001,2 = .95, standard error of the estimate = 1.14, residual sum of squares (RSS) = 68.89, predicted residual error sum of squares (PRESS) = 77.67—between age and wear and multivariate adaptive regression splines (2 = .95, generalised cross validation = 1.67, RSS = 67.68, PRESS = 89.34), which are used to develop an R‐package that users may employ to estimate age‐at‐death from dental wear. The accuracy of this method (78–98%) is evaluated using leave‐one‐out cross‐validation. Analyses of males versus females, deciduous versus permanent, upper versus lower, and anterior versus posterior teeth revealed no apparent reason to warrant separate methods for these groups of separated dentitions. This method fills a disciplinary gap in the understudied area of deciduous and nonadult dental wear and hopes to stimulate much future research. With the R‐package, we also provide the foundation and framework for the development of additional reference populations across different spatiotemporal contexts, to make the method more widely applicable."

The dissertation principally applies microscopic wear trace analysis supported by experimental archaeology to examine the manufacturing technology and use of the studied objects. Integrated with contextual analysis and provenance data, the reconstructed biographies form a window into cross-cultural patterns of artefact production, function, and circulation. These are interpreted following a relational perspective adopted from Amerindian ontologies. The exchange of ground stone celts is shown to be closely interrelated with regional network structures. Though only specific communities specialised in production activities, requisite technical knowledge was widely shared. Once acquired, even exotic rocks and tool types were polished, hafted, and used in conventional ways. Conversely, the cultural and social values of most carved shell and bone paraphernalia are foremost expressed in local technological traditions and the preservation of inherited practices. These findings produce a better understanding of indigenous material culture and its relation to social interactions in the pre- and early colonial Caribbean."

In this paper, we contribute to the debate about cultural attribution of the Rudki-type double spiral ornaments considering their chemical and isotope characteristics (using ED XRF and MC-ICP-MS) and the manufacturing technology (OM, X-ray, CT). Noticeably, this study represents the first documented implementation of the lead isotope analysis (LIA) for the Eneolithic metalwork from Poland. The new scientific analyses give ground to the hypothesis that the Rudki-type double spiral ornaments were produced by the Baden culture metalworker(s) who practiced somewhere in the Carpathian Basin and who have used copper ore mined in the Slovak Ore Mountains (Spania Dolina-Banska Bystrica-Kremnica mine complex). These ornaments were redistributed towards the northern ecumene of the Baden culture complex. The new owners, the Funnel Beaker (TRB) culture communities from the region of modern Poland, deposited the ornaments in hoards (Kaldus, Przeuszyn and Rudki) during the mid-4th millennium BC. The results, furthermore, indicate that the so-called Baden spiral metalwork package must be now complemented by the Rudki-type double spiral ornaments. Remarkably, this package also found an echo in pottery decoration, as documented by a narrative scene incised on an amphora from Kaldus, which could be also interpreted as one of the earliest known proofs for the wagon transport in Europe, alongside the famous ones reported from Bronocice or Flintbek."

The exchange of exotic valuables was vital for the emergent relationships between European colonists and indigenous peoples during the late 15th and early 16th century Caribbean. As the colonial presence became more pressing and intercultural dynamics more complex, formerly distinct material worlds increasingly entangled. Archaeologists have long given minimal attention to these material correlates of indigenous colonial transition. Nevertheless, more than fifty years of archaeological work in Hispaniola has revealed a select number of indigenous sites yielding such foreign artefacts, or objects with European influence, occasionally appearing in reworked, repurposed, or copied forms. Among these are glass beads, metal items, and glazed ceramics, found in a variety of contexts and ranging from singular finds to direct associations to indigenous valuables. This paper presents an overview of these findings in order to explore indigenous agencies in the ways of handling these objects related to the differential impacts of colonial power on the island. As such, this paper aims to advance our understanding of the materiality of things in these encounters and the transformations they brought about in indigenous material culture repertoires."

These objects therefore provide unique insights into the built environment of sanctuaries at this important Greek colony in Sicily. This research's multi-disciplinary approach to the material allows for the creation of a revised typology, which takes into account stylistic characteristics, fabric, production techniques, material composition, and architectural context. The investigation is based on original analyses and documentation of over 250 fragments, of which a significant number was previously unpublished. By approaching these objects as complex architectural elements, and not just as decorative roof edges, a more nuanced image of local production is revealed. While the terracotta roofs from Akragas demonstrate a proficiency in regional stylistic and technical conventions, a number of adaptations is used in the decoration, profile and production techniques, which changes throughout different time periods. By investigating the required technical knowledge and the use of a local technical style, this research has gained new insights into the organization of local production and the distribution of architectural innovations."

In a case study in the central Netherlands, we are currently developing novel methods for multi-class archaeological object detection in LiDAR data based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs). This research is embedded in a long-term investigation of the prehistoric landscape of our study region. We here present an innovative integrated workflow that combines machine learning approaches to automated object detection in remotely sensed data with a two-tier citizen science project that allows us to generate and validate detections of hitherto unknown archaeological objects, thereby contributing to the creation of reliable, labeled archaeological training datasets. We motivate our methodological choices in the light of current trends in archaeological prospection, remote sensing, machine learning, and citizen science, and present the first results of the implementation of the workflow in our research area."

Neolithic ceramics from 13 different sites have been studied with handheld X-ray fluorescence (hXRF) spectroscopy and thin section petrography. The geochemical signature of these ceramics was defined, and four compositional groups were determined. The variation in these compositional groups most likely relates to the ceramic wares for the Mushki and Bashi ceramics and to the site or group of sites for the Jari ceramics. Additionally, sediment samples were studied with hXRF demonstrating the variability in the geochemistry of the area. To determine the composition of the slips used for Bashi and Jari ceramics and to compare them with the inner fabric of the vessels, micro X-ray fluorescence (XRF) spectroscopy was applied. The combination of these archaeometrical techniques indicated the use of unaltered, fine-grained, and mainly alluvial clays without the addition of temper (except for chaff) for the production of the three studied wares and the use of different clay types through the Neolithic in the Kur River Basin."

Nevertheless, the study of the functionality and use-life of such items has developed rather late compared to other categories of objects (e.g. flint implements). Currently, experimental archaeology and use-wear analysis concerning metalwork are facing the challenge of leaving the stage of ‘infancy’ to become fully developedields of study. This paper aims at contributing to such a development by illustrating the potential and the results of an experimental framework for the investigation of combat with bronze weaponry (swords in this paper) which offers a viable compromise between actualism and variable control. We provide an in-depth account of the results by describing both the morphology and the formation mechanics of the features obtained supported by extensive photographic documentation. Furthermore, we discuss our observations regarding the relationship between specific combat movements and the type of marks produced on weapons. Finally, the results of a pilot use-wear study on Bronze Age swords are presented in order to assess the validity of our approach."

The utility of this approach is demonstrated by exploring the example of anthropogenic space as a key context of human-bird figurations. Each contributing paper of the special issue, which will be introduced in more detail below, foregrounds different aspects and emphasises varying dimensions of the triangle, thus contributing in different ways to archaeo-ornithological research.

Contested between the Dutch, French, and English, the island attracted thousands of ships a year and became one of the most cosmopolitan places in the New World. Moreover, the island played an important role in the American War of Independence (1775-1783), during which large quantities of arms, ammunition, and gunpowder were shipped to the fledgling United States through St. Eustatius. Relics of this turbulent past are found all over the island and in its surrounding waters. These include warehouses in the historic port district, fortifications all around the island, sugar plantations in the countryside, and a variety of underwater archaeological sites such as shipwrecks, anchorage areas, and docks. Through extensive archaeological and documentary research, this study aims to provide a detailed analysis of the maritime cultural landscape of St. Eustatius over the past four centuries. It focuses on bridging the gap between the marine and terrestrial worlds and demonstrates that in order to truly make sense of the complex interactions, events, and processes that shaped this maritime world, land and sea need to be studied in relation to each other."

We then used data derived from these 3D models to make quantitative comparisons of artifact attributes that have previously been argued to distinguish the two stone tool industries in question. These attributes include the angle between the platform and flaking surfaces, the shape of core cross sections, and the angle between core axes. The conception of this study was not to privilege the use of new technological and statistical approaches over more traditional or qualitative forms of lithic analysis. Rather, our aim was to experiment with using digital tool to develop nuanced, reproducible ways to describe variability in lithic artifacts.Our results support the hypothesis that there is a difference in the angle between core surfaces between these two industries. Our analysis also indicates a difference in the angle between core axes, although we are more cautious in interpreting these results. An elliptical Fourier analysis of core cross section shape was inconclusive. We discuss what archaeological and methodological factors may have contributed to our results, and the roles of both qualitative and quantitative observations in archaeological research. 3D artifact models generated for this study are included as supplemental data and are available for use by other researchers."

However, few rice starch grains have been identified to date. To understand this apparent scarcity of starch grains from rice, dry- and wet-grinding experiments with stone tools were carried out on four types of cereals: rice (Oryza sativa L.), foxtail millet (Setaria italica), Job's tears (Coix lacryma-jobi L.) and barley (Hordeum vulgare L.). The results reveal that dry-grinding produces significant damage to starches to the point where they may be undetected in archaeological samples, while wet-grinding causes only slight morphological changes to the starch grains. Moreover, rice starch grains have the most substantial alterations from dry-grinding, possibly impeding their identification. These findings provide a possible means to explain the relative scarcity of rice starch grains recovered from archaeological grinding tools, which it is suggested was caused by the use of the dry-grinding technique. Therefore, it is suggested that rice starch grains have been likely underrepresented in the archaeological record, and previous interpretations of starch analyses need to be reconsidered."

The provenience of aquatic lipids in pottery is generally connected to vessel function (e.g., for cooking or storing fish, shellfish and aquatic mammals). However, ethnographic reports from early historic Alaska mention the use of aquatic oils for waterproofing low-fired pottery. Results of lipid residue studies on Alaskan pottery reflect an exclusive function of pottery to process aquatic resources. However, can one be sure these residues are the product of vessel function and not a remnant of the manufacturing process? The study presents the results of an experiment where the preservation of aquatic lipids during the firing process at different temperatures was measured. It was found that nearly all lipids were removed at firing temperatures of ≥ 400°C. Petrographic analysis of Alaskan pottery samples indicates that firing temperatures were generally > 550°C but < 800°C. The contribution of pre-firing manufacture-derived lipids to samples fired at these temperatures may be regarded as negligible. While the possible presence of aquatic lipids from post-firing surface treatments cannot be excluded, such treatments appear unnecessary for well-fired pottery"

The recent fieldwork at Les Cottés (France) transitional site offers a good opportunity to document subsistence strategies for this period and to provide for the first time high-resolution insights on its evolution. We present the results of the complete zooarchaeological and taphonomic analysis of the transitional sequence, associated with a large regional synthesis of the subsistence strategy evolution during the Middle to Upper Paleolithic. We conclude that, while there is no major change in the hunting strategies, the butchery activities evolved in strict correlation with the development of range weapons. In addition, the demise of carnivore seems to be a consequence of the human pressure on the environment. Our study demonstrates how the faunal component of the environment became a structuring element of the human social organization, being at the base of future cultural evolutions."

What can the rock art tell us about the relationship between the nomads and their desert landscape? This book investigates these questions through a comprehensive study of over 4500 petroglyphs from the Jebel Qurma region of the Black Desert in north-eastern Jordan. It explores the content of the rock art, how it was produced and consumed by its makers and audience, and its relationship with the landscape. This is the first-ever systematic study of the Safaitic petroglyphs from the Black Desert and it is unique for the study of Arabian rock art. It demonstrates the value of a material approach to rock art and the unique insights that rock art can provide into the relationship between nomadic herders and the wild and domestic landscape."

Research about the site offered the opportunity to assess some of the earliest Spanish, Amerindian and African entanglements and interactions in the Americas. Additionally, the site of La Vega Vieja has a tightly dated context (1495 to 1564) with no large, subsequent, occupation until the 20th century. The combination of both historical and archaeological data about Concepción de la Vega can help create a better understanding of the process through which the Spanish-American cultural tradition was created, and later disseminated, to the rest of Latin America.The research presented here focuses on the use of all artifacts (not just ceramics) as opposed to artifact manufacture chaine opératoire. It will focus particularly on use in nondomestic areas. This will be more in keeping with new trends in archaeological research, focusing more on problem solving, as opposed to a more chronological or typological approach."

Most such studies to date have focused on the analysis of a single tooth sample per individual to identify migration. Increasingly, however, studies have analyzed multiple teeth from the same individual permitting the detection of migrations occurring during childhood, more fine-grained temporal resolution of the age at which migration(s) occurred, and even the identification of multiple migration episodes. In this study, we review the application of such approaches to a wide range of archeological contexts worldwide. We compiled and analyzed published Sr-87/Sr-86 data for 1043 individuals from 122 sites to explore the potential variability of childhood mobility patterns cross-culturally. The results demonstrate a high degree of variability in childhood mobility that differs significantly between different regions and time periods. Potential interpretations involved in multiple tooth Sr-87/Sr-86 analysis are reviewed, including heterogeneity in variance of regional Sr-87/Sr-86, as well as variability in human mobility patterns such as residential change of whole family, fosterage, herding activities, post-marital residence rules, or forced migrations. Various limitations and caveats concerning the multiple teeth sampling approach are also critically discussed."

This has generally been interpreted as resulting from the production of black pigment that may have been applied to the body as a form of symbolic expression [3]. However, Heyes and colleagues [4] demonstrate that MnO2 can reduce the auto-ignition temperature of wood by upwards of 100°C and suggest that this special pyrotechnic property of powdered MnO2 may have been appreciated by Neandertals. Specifically, they suggest that the addition of MnO2 to tinder materials may have aided in fire-making. Recent findings suggesting that late Neandertals were producing fire by artificial means as early as 50,000 years ago lend credence to this hypothesis [4]. The purpose of the study described here is to test the utility of MnO2 as a tinder enhancer during actualistic fire-making experiments. The flint-and-pyrite fire-making method was employed to produce sparks that were directed onto different types of tinder, both with and without added MnO2, to determine if and the degree to which this material improves the ability of the tinders to capture sparks, allowing them to propagate into a glowing ember. The initial results of this study lend support to the hypothesis of Heyes and colleagues by demonstrating that MnO2 improves the spark capturing efficiency of tinder material over untreated tinder, thereby reducing the time and energy required to produce fire using the percussive fire-making method. However, it was also observed that the incorporation of pyrite dust into the untreated tinder over the course of the experiments appeared to improve its ability to capture sparks, lending to the idea that pyrite powder added to tinder prior to making fire could also expedite the process and largely negate the need for collecting MnO2 for this purpose.[1] Pitarch Martí, A., d'Errico, F., 2018.

To address this problem, here we present the first data from microscopic remains preserved in prehistoric dental calculus from Finland. We extracted and analysed both plant and animal microremains from human calculus and burial site sediment samples, originating from Luistari cemetery in southwestern Finland (samples from c. 600–1200 calAD). We recovered phytoliths, parasites, fibers and feathers. While in Finland few previous archaeological studies have investigated phytoliths, our study confirms the importance of these microremains for interpretating dietary patterns. It is also the first time that intestinal parasites have been reported in Finland.Our study demonstrates that, especially when working with acidic sediments typical for boreal environments, microremain studies can considerably increase the information value of archaeological samples, and that dental calculus and phytolith analysis are important new methods in the research of prehistorical lifestyles. This combined microremain analysis should be more broadly applied in contexts where other dietary records do not remain."

From the Greek idolization of the young athlete, over the condescending attitudes towards manual labor, to Olympic performers who push their bodies beyond all limits for prestige. This fascination with how we use our bodies extends into the questions we ask about past societies.This dissertation examines how we can reconstruct physical activity by looking at variations in the shape of muscle attachment sites ( ‘entheses’) on the human skeleton. It evaluates two post-medieval contexts; rural Middenbeemster and urban Aalst. Findings show societal differences in the sexual division of labor, but also remind us not to over-simplify the lives of people in the past, nor underestimate the complexity of the human body and its varied response to strain.The dissertation also broaches an entirely new field of study; variation in appearance of entheses in growing, individuals. By developing a standardized method, it lies the foundation for research into activity reconstruction in children from both archaeological and forensic settings.Ultimately, it provides the reader with a comprehensive study of the potential and limitations of entheses for activity reconstruction. In doing so, it presents a glimpse into life in the past."

Other sites also contribute to this record of humanoccupation; a second locality at Happisburgh, referred to as Site 1, attests to human presence at around500 ka (MIS 13). This paper provides the first comprehensive account of research undertaken at HappisburghSite 1 since 2000. The early human landscape and depositional environment was that of a riverfloodplain, where an active river channel, in which a grey sand was deposited, was abandoned, forming afloodplain lake, with marginal marsh/swamp environments, which was infilled with organic mud. Thissuccession is sealed by Middle Pleistocene glacial deposits. An assemblage of 199 flint flakes, flake toolsand cores was recovered from the grey sand and organic mud. The evidence from Happisburgh Site 1 isplaced in the context of the wider British and European MIS 13 record. The growing evidence for asignificant dispersal of humans into northern Europe around 500 ka raises critical questions concerningthe environmental conditions under which this took place. We also consider the evolutionary andbehavioural changes in human populations that might have enabled the more widespread and persistentperiod of human presence in northern Europe at this time."

Through a stratigraphic and technological approach to ceramic analysis, this research aims to reconstruct the socially learned practices involved in pottery manufacture. Therefore, macro-fabric analysis and thin section petrography are employed for characterizing clay procurement and preparation practices, as well as firing techniques. Additionally, a macro-trace examination of the sherds revealed fashioning, finishing, surface, and decoration techniques, which were integrated with a morphometric study. The combination of different analytical approaches identifies the production of griddles as local. As a result, the dichotomy between indigenous and exogenous blurs, and innovations in vessel shape might have entangled the interweaving of shared foodways through networked practices, but do not imply arrival or displacement ofat Barillas."

Hussain engages with the long-standing issue of French-Anglophone research conflicts in Palaeolithic archaeology. By examining a range of well-selected case studies and discursive contexts, the author shows that French and Anglophone approaches in lithic analysis are anchored in opposing cognitive frameworks. He argues that the mainstays of this division can be elucidated by calling upon the marginalised work of American philosopher Stephen C. Pepper, who captured the totality of credible Western thought in terms of four equitable world hypotheses. Based upon his insights, the dissertation demonstrates that French lithic research gravitates towards ‘contextualistic’ and ‘organicistic’ modes of inquiry, while Anglophone approaches tend to rely on ‘formistic’ and ‘mechanistic’ styles of reasoning. Hussain carefully lays out the implications of this condition for mutual understanding and critical practice. He contends that the French-Anglophone divide can only be overcome if scholars endorse scientific pluralism and begin to seriously take into consideration both the strengths and shortcomings of different cognitive frameworks, including their own."

Both approaches were considered from a historical perspective and are presented with the analysis of ancient mantic documents and the archaeological record of the sacred landscape. Due to the importance given to symbols and landscape by the Zapotec peoples, the documentation and interpretation of the heritage of the Saa is the result of a tight collaboration with peoples of the communities involved in this work. The ritual experts in mantic, healing and ritualistic activities of the Dilla Xhon variant (Cajonos Zapotec) are called Weneya’a, which means “the one who speaks with the mountains”. The Weneya’a give meaning to the cultural heritage of their communities, to their sacred places, to their religious calendar, to life and death. They also heal the sick, give advice to future married couples and include new-borns as part of the community, all of this according to their sacred landscape.

This conclusion was primarily based on elevated nitrogen isotope ratios in Neandertal bone collagen and has been significantly debated. This discussion relies on the observation that similar high nitrogen isotopes values could also be the result of the consumption of mammoths, young animals, putrid meat, cooked food, freshwater fish, carnivores, or mushrooms. Recently, compound-specific C and N isotope analyses of bone collagen amino acids have been demonstrated to add significantly more information about trophic levels and aquatic food consumption. We undertook single amino acid C and N isotope analysis on two Neandertals, which were characterized by exceptionally high N isotope ratios in their bulk bone or tooth collagen. We report here both C and N isotope ratios on single amino acids of collagen samples for these two Neandertals and associated fauna. The samples come from two sites dating to the Middle to Upper Paleolithic transition period (Les Cottés and Grotte du Renne, France). Our results reinforce the interpretation of Neandertal dietary adaptations as successful top-level carnivores, even after the arrival of modern humans in Europe. They also demonstrate that high δ15N values of bone collagen can solely be explained by mammal meat consumption, as supported by archeological and zooarcheological evidence, without necessarily invoking explanations including the processing of food (cooking, fermenting), the consumption of mammoths or young mammals, or additional (freshwater fish, mushrooms) dietary protein sources."

This study builds on previous research by testing human and faunal dental enamel samples from three sites in the Third Cataract region: Tombos, Hannek, and Abu Fatima. The addition of Abu Fatima and Hannek into the assessment of the Third Cataract region brings new temporal and socioeconomic juxtapositions that can shed light on migration and locality in Bronze Age Nubia.Two faunal samples, a sheep from Abu Fatima and a horse from Tombos, had 87Sr/86Sr values that were consistent with the previously established local Third Cataract strontium range. Seven of the 29 human samples tested for Abu Fatima are suggestive of non-local origin and consistent with the Second Cataract region. One of the four individuals tested from Hannek may have migrated to the region from Egypt or the Second Cataract region. Lastly, four of the 30 samples from Tombos indicate possible non-local origin; the 87Sr/86Sr values may suggest Egypt, the Second Cataract, or the Fourth Cataract as places of origin. These findings suggest complex human migration networks were present in the Nile Valley during the Bronze Age.

We focus on differences among villages with different levels of integration into the market economy and explore potential pathways through which two key elements of the food environment (food availability and food accessibility) might alter the diets of contemporary hunter-gatherers. Results suggest that people living in isolated villages have more diverse diets than those living in villages closer to markets. Our results also suggest that availability of nutritionally important foods (i.e., fruits, vegetables and animal foods) decreases with increasing market integration, while availability of fats and sweets increases. The differences found seem to relate to changes in the wider food environment (e.g., village level access to wild and/or market foods and seasonality), rather than to individual-level factors (e.g., time allocation or individual income), probably because food sharing reduces the impact of individual level differences in food consumption. These results highlight the need to better understand the impact of changes in the wider food environment on dietary choice, and the role of the food environment in driving dietary transitions."

At Fontana Manca (c. 1000 m asl) it started around 1700 BC, in the higher uplands a few centuries later (Lago Forano, c. 1500 m asl). In the Fontana Manca fill, a thin tephra layer occurs, which appears to result from the AP2 event (Vesuvius, c. 1700 BC). A third, major degradation phase dates from the Roman period. Land use and its impacts, as inferred from the regional archaeological record for the Raganello catchment, are confronted with the impacts deduced from the palaeo-archives."

After critically reviewing the existing hypotheses, this article continues the path indicated by Martínez de la Peña (1970) and Peter Mason (2015, 2017), who have identifiedseveral details of the painting as typical of the Canary Islands and its original inhabitants. This article proposes that the mountain of central importance in the painting corresponds to the Roque Bentaiga of Gran Canaria, that the striking stone arch is the nearby rock formation called “Ventana del Bentaiga” and that the snow-topped mountain in the background must be the Teide, a volcano on the neighbouring island of Tenerife, visible from this area. The conclusion is that the painting depicts the battle that took place at this site in 1483 between the troops of the Spanish conquistador Pedro de Vera and the Canaries who opposed them with fierce resistance."

In deze studie zijn oude opgravingsgegevens uitgewerkt en vertaald naar nieuwe inzichten in de inrichting en ontwikkeling van dit indrukwekkende prehistorische cultuurlandschap. Een van de opvallende resultaten van dit onderzoek is dat de nederzettingsterreinen vaak vele generaties bewoond zijn, maar tegelijkertijd een dynamisch karakter hebben. Continuïteit was er op locaties waar een huisplaats is ingericht: nieuwe boerderijen werden vaak generaties lang op dezelfde plaats als de voorgangers gebouwd. Maar we zien ook dat huisplaatsen die generaties lang bewoond zijn geweest, op een zeker moment werden opgegeven en een andere functie krijgen. Door de lange bewoningsduur van terreinen en goede conservering en herkenbaarheid van grondsporen, zijn de Westfriese vindplaatsen bij uitstek geschikt om deze dynamiek in beeld te brengen.

Here, we show, by accelerator mass spectrometry radiocarbon dating of 23 individuals, including cross-validation by compound-specific analysis, thatsurvived in Eastern Europe and Central Asia until at least 39,000 years ago, corroborating a wave of megafaunal turnover before the Last Glacial Maximum in Eurasia, in addition to the better-known late-glacial event. Stable isotope data indicate a dry steppe niche forand, together with morphology, a highly specialized diet that probably contributed to its extinction. We further demonstrate, with DNA sequencing data, a very deep phylogenetic split between the subfamilies Elasmotheriinae and Rhinocerotinae that includes all the living rhinoceroses, settling a debate based on fossil evidence and confirming that the two lineages had diverged by the Eocene. As the last surviving member of the Elasmotheriinae, the demise of the ‘Siberian unicorn’ marked the extinction of this subfamily."

These remains, however, provide an incomplete view of those who carved them, and this study aims to provide new information on these nomads by studying the rich and well-preserved archaeological remains they left behind. It specifically focuses on stone-built architecture, notably burial cairns found often on hilltops and ridges, and enclosures situated at campsites used by nomads. These features are studied through archaeological methods such as remote sensing, field surveys and excavations. The study makes clear that in addition to textual and pictorial carvings nomadic communities invested significantly in their surroundings through the construction of elaborate and long-lasting structures. These served various social and economic purposes on the short and long term. The study thus provides an alternative view on nomad-landscape interaction in anntiquity."

This perspective is explored through two archaeological case studies from Peru and Guatemala, where competing concerns about altitude, climate, disease, violence and populations of differentiated labouring bodies (both human and non-human) came to the fore in unexpected ways. The resulting discussion challenges the reliance on abstract analytical totalities like ‘capitalism’ and ‘colonialism’, and shifts attention towards the diverse assemblages of actors that shaped and continue to shape the processes central to political economic analyses."

However, the means by which Neandertals procured their fire—either through the collection of natural fire, or by producing it themselves using tools—is still a matter of debate. We present here the first direct artefactual evidence for regular, systematic fire production by Neandertals. From archaeological layers attributed to late Mousterian industries at multiple sites throughout France, primarily to the Mousterian of Acheulean Tradition (MTA) technoculture (ca. 50,000 years BP), we identify using microwear analysis dozens of late Middle Palaeolithic bifacial tools that exhibit macroscopic and microscopic traces suggesting repeated percussion and/or forceful abrasion with a hard mineral material. Both the locations and nature of the polish and associated striations are comparable to those obtained experimentally by obliquely percussing fragments of pyrite (FeS2) against the flat/convex sides of a biface to make fire. The striations within these discrete use zones are always oriented roughly parallel to the longitudinal axis of the tool, allowing us to rule out taphonomic origins for these traces. We therefore suggest that the occasional use of bifaces as ‘strike-a-lights’ was a technocultural feature shared among the late Neandertals in France."

This paper argues that in a Bronze Age context, pits associated with fire remains marked out directionality and axiality in the landscape as part of ceremonial events of a temporary nature. Adopting a landscape approach and going beyond regional and chronological borders, the authors argue that in northwestern Europe such events took place in relation to unbounded barrow landscapes in open spaces and could often be linked to the orchestration of funerary events. In some regions, the depositional activities evident in relation to these aligned pits have added significance. Furthermore, the authors argue that the aligning of fire pits is incompatible with divided or parcelled landscapes, thus challenging interpretations of pitted lines as territorial and field boundaries."

We analyze data on food consumption of children from three Indigenous societies with relatively little involvement in the market economy: the Tsimane' (Bolivian Amazon), the Baka (Congo Basin), and the Punan Tubu (Borneo), as such societies allow for the rare possibility to see relationships that become hard to spot once external influences become commonplace. We describe children's diets and measure dietary quality through two standard indicators: dietary diversity and dietary quality (proxied by fruits and vegetables and animal source food consumption). The diversity of Indigenous children's diets varied from one society to another but was high compared to previously reported data. Overall, children's diets were more diverse than adults' diets, without stark differences between the diets of boys and girls or between children of different ages. There was a tendency for more diverse diets amongst children who attend school compared to those who do not. Children in the sample rely on a complex mixture of locallysourced foods (mainly fruits, vegetables, and animal source foods) and products from the market (mainly oils, sweets, spices, and beverages). Findings from this work suggest that Indigenous children remain highly dependent on forest resources and subsistence agriculture for their diets. In that sense, the implications of the ongoing environmental changes on Indigenous children's diets require more scholarly attention."

To achieve this, it was investigated to what extent corrosion and the issues surrounding surface measurements affect the potential of this type of research. Analyses on early Roman period brooches gathered in the Nijmegen region of the Netherlands were subsequently compared with published data."

En ese entonces, contribuciones de académicos como Walter Christaller (1966) y otros se incorporan en la arqueología como una herramienta metodológica que permitía un acercamiento a aquellos espacios territoriales que habían sido ocupados en el pasado (Clarke 1977; Johnson 1977). En Latinoamérica, y en particular, en el área andina y regiones aledañas, esta preocupación puede ser remontada a esfuerzos pioneros como los de Gordon R. Willey (1953), que serían posteriormente complementados por trabajos arqueológicos de análisis espacial y regional, estudiados tanto a partir de contextos arqueológicos (Moore 1996; Netherly 1984) como a partir de evidencia material y documentos históricos (Zuidema 1962; cf.

Recently, it has been proposed that dental calculus may provide a more robust environment for DNA preservation than other skeletal remains, but this has not been systematically tested. In this study, shotgun-sequenced data from paired dental calculus and dentin samples from 48 globally distributed individuals are compared using a metagenomic approach. Overall, we find DNA from dental calculus is consistently more abundant and less contaminated than DNA from dentin. The majority of DNA in dental calculus is microbial and originates from the oral microbiome; however, a small but consistent proportion of DNA (mean 0.08 ± 0.08%, range 0.007–0.47%) derives from the host genome. Host DNA content within dentin is variable (mean 13.70 ± 18.62%, range 0.003–70.14%), and for a subset of dentin samples (15.21%), oral bacteria contribute > 20% of total DNA. Human DNA in dental calculus is highly fragmented, and is consistently shorter than both microbial DNA in dental calculus and human DNA in paired dentin samples. Finally, we find that microbial DNA fragmentation patterns are associated with guanine-cytosine (GC) content, but not aspects of cellular structure."

The exact process by which hominins first learned to use and to create fire is still hotly debated, with some arguing for a sudden transformative event that was quickly followed by a biological and cultural dependence on fire, such as a reliance on the extra calories saved through cooking food and an external source of heat. Others suggest that the 'domestication' of fire was a long and drawn-out process, with hominins using fire when it was available on the landscape but perhaps not having the ability to produce fire until much later in human history. In this paper we propose a third option, that fire should be considered like other technologies - that is, it certainly comes with benefits but also with costs, and that hominins functioned as optimal foragers who chose to use this tool only when the costs were less than the benefits. The potential benefits of fire have been well-described in other publications. Here we discuss in detail the various kinds of costs associated with fire and how these costs could, and do, structure human fire-use behavior. We then describe a small experiment to 'put some numbers on' the potential costs of fire, by quantifying one of the most expensive costs (fuel collection) and comparing it to one of the most-praised benefits (cooking of food). The results suggest that the costs of fuel collection are very high in less-forested environments, and that excessively large amounts of cooked foods are needed to match the total costs of fuel collection and the act of cooking. Overall, the costs of fire can be quite high and must be considered when proposing models for pre-modern human adoption and regular use of fire technologies."

While it is widely agreed that fire would have been of great assistance in moving into areas with a temperate climate, early sites from middle latitudes across Eurasia lack convincing evidence for fire use before about 400,000 years ago. It is not clear whether this represents a real pattern, or a limitation to past research methods and survival. Establishing a firm chronology for the use of fire requires refined interpretation of fire residues at early sites. An alternative approach, taking the pattern (provisionally) as real, is to investigate how hominins could have solved important survival problems at middle latitudes without using fire. This article addresses strategies for thermoregulation in the absence of fire in conditions experienced by hominins in north-west Europe before 400,000 years ago. Four main hypotheses are proposed, involving strategies based primarily on 1) winter fur and subcutaneous fat, 2) hibernation, 3) enhanced heat production, and 4) a combination of cultural insulation particularly clothing and insulative baby carriers with enhanced heat production. Given the trade-offs of these strategies, I will consider their plausibility for the early occupants of Europe, and discuss how the most plausible strategies could be detected in future research."

This data provides information about the geochemical homogeneity within a single batch of raw glass and about the differences and/or similarities between different tank furnaces on a single site. Four glasses from a secondary workshop at Tell el-Ashmunein, Egypt (8th-9th century CE) are analysed for comparative purposes.All raw glass samples have uniform trace element patterns and ratios. Because of poor mixing of the glass batch before and during firing, absolute concentrations however can vary significantly within a single tank furnace. The concentrations of trace elements commonly associated with (de)colouring are very low and can be attributed to background concentrations in the sand raw materials. This indicates that there was no obvious recycling of glass culler at this stage of the production process and that the tank furnace glass is primary glass in the true sense of the word. The isotopic compositions of Sr, Nd and B in the tank furnace glasses are relatively homogeneous. This confirms their potential as provenance indicators. The isotopic composition of Sr in tank furnace glass from Apollonia and Bet Eli'ezer indicates that the lime was derived from seashell, suggesting the glass was produced from beach sand. Glass from Tell el-Ashmunein contains Sr with lower Sr-87/Sr-86 ratios, pointing to the use of limestone as the source of lime. All primary glasses from Israel analysed have Nd isotopic compositions typical for an Eastern Mediterranean origin. delta B-11 indicates that natron used in the tank furnaces in Apollonia and Bet Eli'ezer was most likely imported from Egypt"

To achieve a high level of resolution, three city blocks (insulae), were selected as case studies: III, i; IV, ii; and V, ii.to contextualize these hydraulic systems, the present study developed a new methodology, the Roman Water Footprint. The method was inspired by 21st century ways of understanding how and why water is used in modern cities. These modern insights have indicated that sustainable water usage is based not only on advanced hydraulic technology, but also includes environmental factors, and a strong cultural factor.The results of the study indicate that Roman water usage was much more diverse and flexible than has been previously appreciated.By placing Roman water systems into dialogue with the methodologies of modern sustainable water research, this study forms an initial bridge between modern and ancient approaches to water and urbanism."

This way of doing archeology in the Mixteca is relevant because, on the one hand, it allows the parameters in which this practice has been classified to be broadened and, on the other, it reinforces the identification of contemporary societies with the pre-colonial past.

Economical interactions between Dutch and Portuguese preceded the formation of Dutch Brazil since agents were involved in an array of material exchanges in Europe and in Portuguese America. After 1630, this did not change much. On a daily basis, historical actors extended credit, borrowed money, operated in retail trade, the sugar and dye wood industries, as well as in the slave trade. Long before Dutch rule in Brazil, individuals were able to exploit Dutch and Portuguese legisla-tion to defend their interests.

Zooarchaeological analysis revealed the presence of modified and unmodified bones and teeth from numerous imported mammal species. Local geographic and environmental conditions preclude permanent establishment of terrestrial mammal populations and as such, there are no native mammalian taxa on the island itself or the surrounding oceanic archipelago. The presence of these faunal remains on Dos Mosquises can be attributed to the intentional movement of animal resources from the mainland to Los Roques by indigenous groups in the Late Ceramic Age (~AD 1200–1500). Despite attributions to a mainland source region, little else is known about the origins of these unique specimens. Here, we apply strontium (87Sr/86Sr), oxygen (δ18O), and carbon (δ13C) isotope analyses of tooth enamel from various archeologically recovered taxa including deer, peccary, tapir, ocelot, margay, opossum, fox, and weasel to investigate their geographic origins via comparisons with macro-regional models of precipitation δ18O and bioavailable 87Sr/86Sr. The 87Sr/86Sr results are highly variable both for the overall assemblage and between specimens within the same taxa, indicating origins from different geochemical environments of mainland South America. The combined archeological and isotopic evidence are consistent with origins within the late pre-colonialwhich encompassed the Lake Valencia Basin, surrounding regions, and several offshore island groups including Los Roques archipelago."

This dissertation presents 195 Caribbean museums and the results of a unique research project. It begins with a macro view of 195 Caribbean museums and their participatory practices and continues by zooming in to a micro level to explore the dynamics of community engagement processes in two case studies. The Kalinago Barana Autê in Dominica shows the ongoing process of an indigenous grassroots initiative that became a governmentally owned museum. The Bengal to Barbados exhibition in Barbados reveals the complex dynamics of a co-curation project by a heterogeneous migrant community.  By giving voice to grassroots museums, this dissertation shifts the museological discussion away from the usual suspects to consider topics such as the ephemeral museum. Recognizing the different forms the museum can take, it becomes apparent that people everywhere in the world need museums, create museums, and visit museums.The 195 museums studied in the course of this dissertation research are accessible through a separate appendix.

These legacy site-based survey data represent an important resource to study ancient settlement organization. Methodological procedures are necessary to cope with the limits of these data, and more importantly with the distortions on data patterns caused by biasing factors. This book develops and applies a GIS procedure to use legacy survey data in settlement pattern analysis. It consists of two parts. One part regards the assessment of biases that can affect the spatial patterns exhibited by survey data. The other part aims to shed light on the location preferences and settlement strategy of ancient communities underlying site patterns. In this book, a case-study shows how the method works in practice. As part of the research by the Landscapes of Early Roman Colonization project (NWO, Leiden University, KNIR) site-based datasets produced by survey projects in central-southern Italy are examined in a comparative framework to investigate settlement patterns in the early Roman colonial period (3rd century B.C.)."

Uncovering possible canoe routes between these communities can help to explain the structure, capabilities, and limitations of the physical links in their social and material networks. This book evaluates how routes connecting islands indicate the structure of past inter-island networks, by using computer modeling.  Computer modeling and least-cost pathway analysis is a popular approach for analyzing the physical connection between sites in archaeology. Over the past three decades researchers have explored several theories and methods to analyze least-cost pathways on landscapes. Land-based least-cost efforts have outpaced the number of works evaluating optimal travel routes across the sea’s surface. Perhaps as a result, no community standard for using computer- and GIS-based methods to model canoe or sailing routes exists. Although methods used in previous research often focus on determining the time-cost and success of specific routes, these measures have been calculated or judged in different ways. One way this book adds to the discussion of seascape modeling is by focusing on inter-island voyaging, or the process of maintained connections between island sites, a technique rarely explored in sea-based least-cost pathways analysis."

However, limitations persist with regard to the interpretation of use and the reconstruction of systems of attachment, hampering a holistic understanding of the diversity of past bodily adornment. This is because the complexities of ornament biographies and the resulting wear traces cannot be grasped exclusively from the study of experimental reference collections. In this paper, we propose to bridge this gap in interpretation by systematically researching ethnographic collections. We conducted a microscopic study of 38 composite ornaments from lowland South America housed at the Musée du quai Branly (Paris). These objects involve organic, biomineral, and inorganic components, attached through different string configurations. The combined use of optical and 3D digital microscopy at different magnification ranges provided a thorough understanding of wear trace formation, distribution, and characterization. We demonstrate how individual beads develop characteristic use-wear in relation to one another and to the strings. We further challenge common assumptions made in the analysis of archaeological ornaments. In sum, this research addresses methodological and interpretative issues in the study of bodily adornment at large, by providing insight into the biographies of objects that were actually worn in a lived context. In the future, our results can be applied as reference for a more effective understanding of the use of ornaments worldwide."

The presence of these sites, combined with mounting evidence from geoarchives of human impact on the landscape since the Neolithic, has led us to investigate the settlement and landscape history of the Northern Franconian Jura in Bavaria as a model region for studying human activity in and impact on the German Central Uplands during the Metal Ages.In this article, we present the first results of an interdisciplinary study of the Weismain river catchment undertaken since 2013. A combination of geoarchaeological and archaeological, on-site and off-site, field and lab investigations at both valley and plateau sites revealed evidence of human land use and settlement from the 16th century BC (Middle Bronze Age) onwards, with further emerging evidence of changing vegetation, land-use strategies and settlement preferences until the end of the Iron Age. While research is still ongoing, it may be concluded that in the study region, and possibly other parts of the German Central Uplands, land use had begun earlier and was more intense and varied than previously thought."

We reconstruct environmental change from a 225-cm-long sediment core from site Los Indios from an abandoned and sediment-filled meander of the Yaque River, Cibao Valley, northeastern Dominican Republic. The sediment record starts ca. AD 195 (ca. 1755 cal. yr BP) and the history of the meander infill was monitored by changing grain size distributions, organic matter concentration and pollen from wetland plants. From ca. AD 200 to ca. AD 1525, the pollen record indicates a diverse forest assemblage; however, the presence of pollen from potential crop plants suggest nearby small-scale subsistence crop cultivation. More abundant charcoal after ca. AD 1410 shows Amerindians increasingly used fire. The record of grain size distributions shows that the meander was temporarily part of a low energetic drainage system in which bedload and suspended sediments accumulated. After European colonization of Hispaniola increasing spores of coprophilous fungi evidence that Europeans had introduced during the first decades of colonization cattle in the Cibao Valley which gradually resulted in more open forest. The charcoal record around ca. AD 1650 reflects intensive forest clearing, suggesting that small-scale Pre-Colonial practice of crop cultivation became replaced by large-scale agriculture on the moist and nutrient rich soils along the Yaque River. Further deforestation and signals of erosion suggest that the population of colonists and introduced enslaved labour force must have increased rapidly. After ca. AD 1740 charcoal influx decreased suggesting that last deforestation activities used selective cutting to produce fire wood and timber for construction, rather than burning forest in situ. Two centuries after European colonization, by the 18th century, land-use within the Cibao Valley had become a balance between substantial livestock and crop cultivation (pollen grains have evidenced cereals, maize, and potentially also sugar cane, amaranthaceous crops and tobacco). After ca. AD 1950, swamp vegetation of Typha and Cyperaceae decreased, pointing to an almost fully terrestrialized meander with only few bodies of standing water, reflecting the present-day setting. This multiproxy reconstruction of anthropogenic environmental change shows a clear differentiation between an immediate introduction of livestock and after some 150 years the development of a European style agriculture, providing a context for archaeological investigations."

The use of ethnohistoric and indirect archaeological evidence is debated, and competing reconstructions of potential botanical foods and their cooking processes have resulted. To address this issue, starch analysis, which is suitable to provide information on human-plant interactions in tropical regions with poor botanical preservation, was carried out on samples from shell and limestone potential plant-processing tools from the Rolling Heads site, Long Island, The Bahamas. Results of this study revealed that some of these shell and lithic tools were used to process several different starchy food sources: maize (L.), manioc (Crantz), and coontie (spp.). The presence of more than one plant species on both the microlith and shell tools, demonstrates their multi-purpose use. These novel data have also generated interpretations of plant processing with limestone grater chips. Overall, our research provides integral data regarding regional-specific processing of manioc, maize, and coontie. This report provides new information regarding human-plant interactions in the Caribbean. Finally, this study provides data on the use of shell tools and lithic graters for processing plants it contributes to ongoing discussions of reconstructing ancient Bahamian and related Caribbean foodways."

Dermal synthesis of vitamin D under the influence of UVB radiation is important for a healthy skeleton and a deficiency may lead to pathological bowing of bones. The Netherlands did not experience the Industrial Revolution as many other European countries did and vitamin D deficiency was expected to be (nearly) absent in Dutch communities. To test this, six 17th - 19th century human skeletal collections from rural and small urban centres were analysed for vitamin D deficiency (N = 632 individuals). Regardless of geographic location, community size, daily activities, and socioeconomic status, all evaluated communities experienced vitamin D deficiency in childhood. Sociocultural practices, such as gender-related activities, as opposed to classic factors, are suggested to have been main etiological agents in the development of vitamin D deficiency. Application of newly developed methods for identification of this disease in teeth, showed vitamin D deficiency to be recurrent and often seasonal. This study stresses the importance of investigating vitamin D deficiency in every community to better understand the deteriorating effect that sociocultural practices may have had on health."

This dissertation situates the continuous importance of non-institutional healing practices within the rich symbolism of Cuban and Dominican landscapes. More specifically, the study focuses on practices promoting physical, mental and spiritual healing of individuals and communities. It provides various examples that illustrate human interactions with divine and ancestral beings residing in places such as water sources, caverns, or manifested in plants and other natural phenomena. Data presented in this work guides our understanding of how local cultural memory plays a key role in our construction of medicinal histories, and the profound demographic and landscape transformations which shaped the healing landscapes after European conquest. Healing landscapes are also testimonies of the Cuban and Dominican ancestors’ creativity, resilience, capacity to heal and find unity in the dehumanizing and alienating atmosphere of colonial violence and exploitation."

In its attempt to answer this question, this thesis is a contribution to understanding variability within and between late Middle Paleolithic assemblages of the European Plain. The selected research area is rich in late Middle Paleolithic open-air sites but up to now lacking detailed quantitative comparisons between them. This thesis uses standardized, more quantitative methods to analyze stone tool variability across techno-complexes. Stone artifact assemblages where analyzed based on a detailed attribute analysis and compared using multivariate methods, like Principal Component Analysis and Nonmetric Multidimensional Scaling. Additionally, methods from 3D geometric morphometrics where applied for the analysis of some individual tool types. The central finding of the studies presented in this thesis is that most of the variability observed in the record is not related to typo-technological classification, and it is not necessarily site-specific nor geographical. The variability can be related to raw materials, but it can also be related to the varying application of similar methods in blank and tool production. The analyses of individual tools suggest further that certain tool concepts, like the bifacial Keilmesser are not restricted to bifacial tools only."

This site is attributed contradicting functions; some identify it as an isolated nature sanctuary, functioning independently of society. Others have emphasised its relation with the nearby settlement of Satricum. To better understand how Laghetto del Monsignore was embedded in local society and how the development of Satricum into an urban settlement affected the cult place, we here adopt a holistic approach, combining a comprehensive analysis of the material culture with spatial analysis of the micro-regional setting of the cult place. This approach highlights transformations in the micro-regional settlement pattern and points out multiple use contexts of the cult place: in the Orientalising and Archaic periods it was part of the sacred landscape of Satricum. However, rural communities and shepherds passing the cult place along transhumance routes also frequented the cult place in its earliest phase, and may have continued to do so alongside Satricum´s urban community."

The results of the current season of excavation confirm the presenceof craft-related areas, at least for the most recent Um An Nar occupations, which were extensivelyexcavated. Furthermore, a series of deep trenches shows the presence of three periods of occupations,spanning from the late Neolithic to the end of the Um An Nar period, and with an intermediate phasethat might be ascribed to the very beginning of the Bronze Age. Although the chronological frame ofthis occupation needs to be verified through further explorations, a stratigraphic sequence of over 2.5m is quite exceptional in the coastal contexts of the area.

We know fire fundamentally changed our relationship with the world by making previously uninhabitable climates tolerable, inedible foods palatable and more nutritious, and providing a focal point around which complex social relationships could develop. It remains uncertain, however, when and in what manner fire became an integral part of the technological repertoire of our early ancestors. This gap in our knowledge prevents a full understanding of how fire affected our physical form and cultural lifeways. The long and drawn out process by which fire progressed from simply being a close companion in the natural environment to becoming a resource  xploited opportunistically by hominins eventually led to greater control of fire. At this point, fire was largely ‘tamed’ through careful maintenance and transported from place to place. Ultimately, likely through a combination of serendipity and experimentation, humans discovered that they could make fire for themselves whenever and wherever they liked, providing a profound new freedom to control their environment, cook their food and produce new materials at will.This article provides an overview of the current state of our understanding of fire use, and more specifically, fire-making in the Paleolithic. There is currently much debate in the field surrounding this issue, and it is stressed herein that the only way to definitively infer any one hominin group could make fire is to identify the tools they used to do so. Therefore, much attention is paid to how archaeologists have attempted to identify fire-making tools in the archaeological record, primarily using experimental archaeology coupled with microwear analysis. Through these efforts, it appears stone-on-stone percussive fire-making using flint and pyrite was a skill first practiced by at least some groups of late Neanderthals, though its origins could be much older. Conversely, preservational problems associated with the wood-on-wood friction fire-making make it extremely difficult to assess the antiquity of this method. Lingering questions regarding early fire-making innovations and possible avenues for future research are discussed."

In New Guinea, the discovery of Late Lapita near Port Moresby has been augmented by findings of Late Lapita ceramics in the western Gulf of Papua. Southwest of the Gulf, undiagnostic locally made ceramics dating to around 2500 years ago are now known in the western Torres Strait. Other, somewhat younger, pottery has been found in the eastern Strait, some of it (or at least some of its constituents) from New Guinea. In addition, undiagnostic locally made surface pottery has recently been found on Lizard Island off Cape York Peninsula. This material is undated but hypothesised to be pre-colonial. Although Macassan fisherman left ceramics and other material remains on the northern Australian coast in the centuries just prior to European settlement, pre-colonial ceramics of any greater antiquity have never been found before in Torres Strait or on mainland Australia or its offshore islands. The proximity of the northern Australian find-spots to the new discoveries of Lapita in southern New Guinea, and the dating of at least some of the Torres Strait pottery to Late Lapita times, raises dramatic new possibilities regarding the course of prehistory in those areas."

While agriculture provides the main source of calories, meat of wild animals, commonly referred to as bushmeat, represents the main source of protein for local people in the region and plays an important role in terms of dietary diversity and health. However, the increase of bushmeat consumption in towns and more efficient hunting practices have pushed the harvest of wild animals to unsustainable levels, generating a “bushmeat crisis”. The growing demand for bushmeat has created strong pressures and a lure of profit pushing the hunters of southern Cameroon to sell (illegally) their harvest. A dynamic that might affect both local diets and the modalities of relations between humans and animals. Therefore, this paper aims to describe the importance of wild meat for the Baka, an ethnolinguistic group of Southeastern Cameroun, traditionally hunter-gatherers. It analyses the place of the animal in the Baka daily life through its contribution in dietary, symbolic and economic terms. The paper combines a qualitative ethnography with individual-level data on food diversity intake and meat selling, and describes different aspects related to meat sharing and consumption."

The present-day shift of attention from collective to individual agency and the countless facets of migration goes hand in hand with new socio-political and cultural scenarios such as the extraordinary migratory flows into Europe, shifting boundaries, alternative forms of citizenship and identity, and the emergence of emotive reactionism.

This research investigates the human pig relationships, using biometry, kill-off patterns and isotopic dietary analysis. With this integrated methodological approach, it might be possible to characterize human-suid relationships in this pivotal Early Neolithic site with greater accuracy. Understanding this relationship at this site contributes to the broader debate on how Neolithisation and domesticates spread through Europe, and which bio-cultural mechanisms were responsible for differential patterns of animal exploitation."

Although most DNA within calculus is microbial, it has been shown to contain sufficient human DNA for the targeted retrieval of whole mitochondrial genomes. Here, we explore whether calculus is also a viable substrate for whole human genome recovery using targeted enrichment techniques. Materials and methodsTotal DNA extracted from 24 paired archaeological human dentin and calculus samples was subjected to whole human genome enrichment using in‐solution hybridization capture and high‐throughput sequencing. ResultsTotal DNA from calculus exceeded that of dentin in all cases, and although the proportion of human DNA was generally lower in calculus, the absolute human DNA content of calculus and dentin was not significantly different. Whole genome enrichment resulted in up to four‐fold enrichment of the human endogenous DNA content for both dentin and dental calculus libraries, albeit with some loss in complexity. Recovering more on‐target reads for the same sequencing effort generally improved the quality of downstream analyses, such as sex and ancestry estimation. For nonhuman DNA, comparison of phylum‐level microbial community structure revealed few differences between precapture and postcapture libraries, indicating that off‐target sequences in human genome‐enriched calculus libraries may still be useful for oral microbiome reconstruction. DiscussionWhile ancient human dental calculus does contain endogenous human DNA sequences, their relative proportion is low when compared with other skeletal tissues. Whole genome enrichment can help increase the proportion of recovered human reads, but in this instance enrichment efficiency was relatively low when compared with other forms of capture. We conclude that further optimization is necessary before the method can be routinely applied to archaeological samples."

Many natural sites are often considered sacred and consequently of both spiritual and biodiversity conservation significance. However, this dualist definition is the one usually imposed by nation-states. Until 2002, Thailand’s development strategies involving indigenous peoples were mostly connected to what was referred to as the ‘hill tribes’ problems’. These strategies were designed without respecting indigenous peoples’ worldviews and concepts of good life. Consequently, a fragmentary worldview was created among indigenous peoples. These issues are reflected in the establishment of National Parks and ‘heritage sites’ as the lack of participation and consent generated many conflicts such as land tenure disputes, resettlement of the communities, difficulties in acquiring citizenship, and cultural loss. As a counteracting measure, indigenous peoples have been creating community museums and organizations at local, regional and even transnational level to sustain their cultures and territories. This paper suggests that heritage can play a role in a wide range of social, political, and economic endeavours in our contemporary world and is used both by nation-states to legitimize their interests and by indigenous peoples to legitimize struggles for self-determination."

Based on the case of the Camëntsá people, I point out some of the reasons for this detachment and suggest that a collaborative and intercultural approach to heritage management is more appropriate, since it is based on an inclusive understanding of heritage and recognizes that not only is this used as a form of resistance, but it is also subject to the interpretation of different groups. In the specific case of archaeology, it is necessary to expand the horizons of the discipline by recognizing the relationship of Indigenous peoples with the material past, and working in a way in which researchers, Indigenous communities and government institutions truly collaborate."

The city was originally founded by Alexander the Great and given the name Alexandria (Campbell et al. 2019: 215). After its destruction by flooding, it was re-founded in BC 166/165 by the Seleucid king Antiochos IV and re-named Antiochia. This settlement was again destroyed by flooding. It was rebuilt under Hyspaosines and named Charax Spasinou (ancient Greek for ‘palisade of [Hy]spa[o]sines’). Due to its favourable location Charax became a very important harbour in the Persian Gulf area and a major trading point between India and Babylonia, supplying goods further up to the Mediterranean (Campbell et al. 2019). Charax was first identified with Jebel Khayaber in 1965, when distinctive ramparts with an average height of 4m to 6m were documented (Hansman 1967: 39). In 2016 Jane Moon, Robert Killick and Stuart Campbell (University of Manchester), together with Stefan Hauser (University of Konstanz) and the Iraqi State Board for Antiquities & Heritage, started a project to document and protect the ancient city of Charax Spasinou.

Applying this reference baseline to Jiahu, an earlysite known for the earliest findings of domesticated rice in the central plain of China, reveals that dry-grinding rather than wet-grinding was employed for cereal (including rice) processing 9000 years ago. This grinding method could have been inherited from the earlier hunter-gatherers, but could also result from a broad-spectrum subsistence strategy adopted at Jiahu.

Starting with in-game maps, sites such as forts, settlements, and infrastructural elements were rebuilt based on geological, archaeological, and historical information. These crowdsourced reconstructions, which not only relied on archaeological knowledge but also on a fair dose of creativity, took place in a series of educational public events in 2017–2019. The case study will detail the results of this project, as well as its methods, thus providing a practical example of digital scholarship which begins with discovery and ends in learning. The paper will conclude by reflecting on how the fun yet unpredictable dynamics of a digital playground not only shape public engagement with the past, but also open up unexpected avenues for more inclusive archaeological scholarship."

In archaeological discussion, the “advanced farming village” is often seen as the logical “end product” of the agricultural transformations that began in the Early (“Pre-Pottery”) Neolithic. However, the complex later prehistoric landscape did not emerge overnight. Current evidence suggests that this profound transformation took about one and a half millennia, and showed much localized variability. Over the past decades, regional surveys have resulted in a rich body of evidence that stimulates the exploration of long-term trends in settlement through the Neolithic period. Here we present a synthesis of this exploration. We highlight some important methodological and conceptual challenges to interpreting these data, and we point out a number of possible shifts in the ways Late Neolithic communities inhabited the landscape."

Chiefs travelled the lands and seas anddominated the acquisition and possession of critical resources. Most researchfocuses on the provenance and distribution of metals and on the mobility ofpeople. Yet, the mobility of one the most obvious sources of social andeconomic wealth in the Bronze Age has got little attention: livestock. Thisstudy explores the possible social role of livestock of cattle and sheep, bothin the household sphere and in the sphere of exchange as a means of ‘connectingpeople’. Here, strontium isotope data is presented from 58 cattle and sheepfrom settlement contexts from Bronze Age West-Frisia (2000-800 BC), theNetherlands, with the aim to gain an isotopic perspective on the socio-economicsignificance of livestock. The data provide evidence for long-distance trade orexchange of livestock. Besides their monetary value, we suggest that livestock,and in particular cattle, may have been perceived as equal to people in termsof labour and production and as members of the household. Their mobility andexchange therefore signal more than just economic trade, it signals a socialpractice. By changing our perspective towards the social ideology of farminglife, we will move closer to understanding Bronze Age societies in more diverseand inclusive ways. Research into livestock mobility is therefore consideredfundamental for a more diverse understanding of Bronze Age farming life."

A complex system consists of separate entities interacting following a set of (often simple) rules that collectively give rise to unexpected patterns featuring vastly different properties than the entities that produced them. In recent years a number of case studies have shown that such approaches have great potential for furthering our understanding of the past phenomena explored in Roman Studies. We argue complexity science and formal modelling have great potential for Roman Studies by offering four key advantages: (1) the ability to deal with emergent properties in complex Roman systems; (2) the means to formally specify theories about past Roman phenomena; (3) the power to test aspects of these theories as hypotheses using formal modelling approaches; and (4) the capacity to do all of this in a transparent, reproducible, and cumulative scientific framework. We present a ten-point manifesto that articulates arguments for the more common use in Roman Studies of perspectives, concepts and tools from the broader field of complexity science, which are complementary to empirical inductive approaches. There will be a need for constant constructive collaboration between Romanists with diverse fields of expertise in order to usefully embed complexity science and formal modelling in Roman Studies."

However, their application for provenance requires the development of baseline models predicting surficial 87Sr/86Sr variations (“isoscapes”). A variety of empirically-based and process-based models have been proposed to build terrestrial 87Sr/86Sr isoscapes but, in their current forms, those models are not mature enough to be integrated with continuous-probability surface models used in geographic assignment. In this study, we aim to overcome those limitations and to predict 87Sr/86Sr variations across Western Europe by combining process-based models and a series of remote-sensing geospatial products into a regression framework. We find that random forest regression significantly outperforms other commonly used regression and interpolation methods, and efficiently predicts the multi-scale patterning of 87Sr/86Sr variations by accounting for geological, geomorphological and atmospheric controls. Random forest regression also provides an easily interpretable and flexible framework to integrate different types of environmental auxiliary variables required to model the multi-scale patterning of 87Sr/86Sr variability. The method is transferable to different scales and resolutions and can be applied to the large collection of geospatial data available at local and global levels. The isoscape generated in this study provides the most accurate 87Sr/86Sr predictions in bioavailable strontium for Western Europe (R2 = 0.58 and RMSE = 0.0023) to date, as well as a conservative estimate of spatial uncertainty by applying quantile regression forest. We anticipate that the method presented in this study combined with the growing numbers of bioavailable 87Sr/86Sr data and satellite geospatial products will extend the applicability of the 87Sr/86Sr geo-profiling tool in provenance applications."

No modern analogues occur in Britain for the assemblages recovered from Saham Toney. Evidence of colder winters or at least warmer summers at the time of deposition does not support the view that sea-level peaked in thezone of the Eemian Stage (correlated with the Ipswichian Stage) associated with increased oceanicity. Southern Britain would have been under the influence of the Atlantic Ocean and a degree of oceanicity is supported by the presence of two thermophilous taxa,and, in the pollen spectra from Saham Toney. Alternative explanations for the presence of these exotic species are that they were tolerating mild winters and cooler summers at the time of deposition or exploiting suitable micro-environments.

While previous experimental studies have demonstrated the physical effects of heat on stony artefacts, the mechanisms influencing the proportion of fire proxy evidence within archaeological layers remain understudied. This fundamental study is the first to apply a computer-based model (fiReproxies) in an attempt to simulate and quantify the complex interplay of factors that ultimately determine when and in what proportions lithic artefacts are heated by (anthropogenic) fires. As an illustrative example, we apply our model to two hypothetical archaeological layers that reflect glacial and interglacial conditions during the late Middle Palaeolithic within a generic simulated cave site to demonstrate how different environmental, behavioural and depositional factors like site surface area, sedimentation rate, occupation frequency, and fire size and intensity can, independently or together, significantly influence the visibility of archaeological fire signals."

The study presented here aims to make a practical contribution to a new understanding and use of 3D reconstructions, namely as “laboratories” to test hypotheses and visualize and evaluate alternative interpretations.  In order to do so, an analysis of visual reconstructions of the early and late modern period is presented first, followed by a discussion of current applications of 3D digital reconstructions, with a special focus on cityscapes. Lastly, the implementation of a research-driven, intellectually transparent and GIS-based 3D reconstruction is proposed for the urban site of Koroneia, in Boeotia, Central Greece.

First, as a primary goal, the research focus is established together with local communities or stakeholders, identifying both direct and indirect causes of landscape change. Second, by using a variety of qualitative and quantitative methods, but grounded in local participation, the research indicates that landscape change never happens in a vacuum but rather, it is always a part of a larger socio-political context and historical background that must be considered. In both case studies, there remains emphasis on the tangible, as results not only lead to new directions in landscape research but also deliverables used by community stakeholders for continued land sustainability. By investigating the synergies of nature and community within landscape change, this research proposes that local communities assert local agency. This moves away from how local communities fit into global phenomena of land change, to how communities can assert their diversity within a global process."

The vegetation on this mountain is threatened by expanding agriculture, deforestation, tourism, and climate change. We present an ethnobotanical inventory among local farmer communities and discuss the effects of vegetation change on the availability of useful plants.MethodsWe used 76 semi-structured, 4 in-depth interviews, and 247 botanical collections to record the ethnoflora of the farmers and surveyed from the high Andean forest to the super-páramo, including native and introduced species. We organized 3 participative workshops with local children, high school students, and campesinos’ women to share the data we acquired in the field and empower local plant conservation awareness.ResultsWe encountered 174 useful plants, most of them native to the area (68%) and almost one third introduced (32%). The Compositae was the most species-rich family, followed by Lamiaceae, Poaceae, and Rosaceae. The majority of plant species were used as medicine, followed by food, firewood, and domestic tools. Local farmers reported declining numbers of páramo species, which were now only found at higher altitudes than before. Although our informants were worried about the preservation of their natural resources and noticed the effects of climate change, for several commercial species, unsustainable land use and overharvesting seemed to be the direct cause of declining medicinal plant resources rather than climate change.ConclusionsWe recommend conservation plans that include vegetation monitoring, people’s perceptions on climate change, and participative actions with the communities of the Sierra Nevada del Cocuy-Güicán."

The results tie into the debate around the dispersal of modern humans into Europe. In this thesis, a multi-proxy chronological approach was applied providing ages for the modern human occupation and behavioural adaptations just outside Europe. At the onset of the Upper Palaeolithic groups at Ksâr ‘Akil relied mainly on terrestrial food resources, which shifted later, during the early Ahmarian, gradually to more extensive exploitation of smaller bodied taxa including the introduction of marine and terrestrial snails into the diet. Oxygen isotope analysis of marine mollusc taxa showed that shellfish exploitation was practiced in all seasons and thus played a central role in EUP foraging strategies. Equally this implies that the site was occupied during different times of the year. With regard of the implications for EUP Homo sapiens, shellfish as a dietary supplement throughout the year enhances the diet nutritionally and likely contributes to healthier populations. This in turn might have facilitated population growth and increased population density in an area that fuelled the modern human dispersals into Europe."

It attempts to increase the diversity of the museological debate by extending the discussion to practices from the Caribbean region.The paper begins by contextualizing the discussion: the history of the purpose of museums as educational institutions is linked to the contemporary transformation to museums as social agents. Youth engagement is placed partially within educational theories, although the important role of museums as facilitators for social inclusion and cultural performances is also stressed. Theoretical concepts are used to present a number of ways in which youth audiences can be defined, for instance by learning style or visiting group. The core of the paper is a collection of Caribbean examples of youth engagement processes or projects grouped by different approaches and desired outcomes. It concludes with a plan of action for youth engagement in museums."

Its elemental and isotopic composition revealed the glass to be of a previously unknown plant ash glass type, different from known contemporary Roman, Mesopotamian, and Indian glass. The Sr isotopic composition of the glass corresponds to locally available plants, pointing to the possible existence of a first-century CE local glass production centre. To explore this possibility, sands from around the UAE were analysed to establish their suitability for glass making and correspondence with the Dibba finds. This paper presents the results of the elemental analysis of fourteen sands. The analysis, performed using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES), revealed all sands to be rich in lime and alumina. X-ray diffraction revealed the presence of calcite and other carbonate minerals, as well as antigorite and quartz. Comparison of the sand compositions to average first-century CE non-Roman glass found at Dibba showed them to be unsuitable as raw material for producing the glass of Dibba.

The ceramic sequence covers a period of several centuries between7000 and 6450 cal BC. The pottery analysis combined bulk processing in the field and archaeometric work in the laboratory to construct a viable ceramic categorization. This paper discusses long-term ceramic trends that follow the first appearance of pottery in the northern Levant, including the development of pottery containers for storage."

It has been suggested that this contact represents an adaptive response to mitigate intrinsic demographic fragility during the initial phases of island colonization, and that this exogamous imperative faded in the aftermath of initial dispersal as overall population density increased. Here, we evaluate this model by synthesizing and comparing increasingly available 87Sr/86Sr data from funerary populations in the Pacific and Caribbean. After performing basic hygienic discrimination, we conclude that the Caribbean data—both from across the region, and on an intra-site/island basis—lend support to this model, with high early in-migration succeeded by comparatively low in-migration in a relationship which, based on chi-square tests, is statistically significant (1,= 290) = 4.046,= 0.044). The Pacific situation is more complex, with data from the Bismarck Archipelago and northern Solomon Islands skewing the analysis. However, in considering these data in detail, we demonstrate that there are reasons to suppose that the Pacific data may also tentatively support a model of high rates of in-migration being replaced later in settlement histories by comparatively low rates. We conclude by highlighting future directions for this incipient research program."

Reconstruction of the size of the arable fields and livestock suggests that animal dung cannot have been the only source of fertilizer. Application of household waste and mud from ditches is considered as well as a possible effect from burning stubble. Growing of pulses was not practiced and therefore this method of ameliorating the soil has to be left out of the question. The outcome of the study presented here is that the Bronze Age farmers of the northwest Netherlands used several means to maintain the fertility of their arable land and that they may have adapted their strategy according to circumstances.

Some are protected as National Heritage, but many are not. Only a small part has ever seen professional archaeological investigation, and there are many for which no more is known than that they are likely to represent ‘prehistoric burial sites’. This applies particularly to mounds in the municipality of Apeldoorn, where large numbers are known to exist and fortunately protected as heritage, but where in most cases not much is known on their dating, nature or potential significance as source of knowledge on the past. This article presents the results of a fieldwork campaign where three newly discovered, small barrows were investigated that are part of a much larger barrow landscape on which so far nothing was known. In spite of their small size and the fact that some were heavily damaged by forest ploughing, the research yielded detailed information on their use history and the social and ritual significance that they had in the Bronze Age. Even the most inconspicuous mound, of which it was initially seriously doubted whether it was a prehistoric monument, appears to contain the remains of many special prehistoric features. It is argued that this small group of three barrows dates to the beginning of the Middle Bronze Age, the period between the 18th and 15th centuries BC and probably represents what was perceived as one ‘community of ancestors’ among a larger ancestral whole. There are indications that it originated around a location that had an older – Late Neolithic – history. It is suggested that this monument had a special role and was the focus of ceremonial activities the likes of which have so far not been detected in the Netherlands: the deposition of loads of stones and pottery in a pit row directed at the location where a barrow would eventually be constructed. Deceased were buried at two locations nearby, both of whom were also covered by mounds. These were collective graves, in which many deceased of both sexes and all ages were buried and no clear distinctions between deceased were emphasized in the burial rituals. There are similarities in the mode of interment in both mounds, and we suggest these barrows are each other’s successors. The fieldwork at the Wieselseweg shows the high potential small-scale research of inconspicuous and damaged burial mounds can have to further our knowledge on the prehistoric legacy of the Netherlands."

Isolated zones of macroscopic and microscopic traces suggesting repeated percussion and/or forceful abrasion with a hard mineral material were identified on dozens of large late Middle Palaeolithic bifacial tools using microwear analytical techniques. These bifaces were curated tools used for relatively long periods of time, and therefore possess a higher probability of preserving traces from multiple uses, including more infrequent activities. Both the distribution and nature of the observed mineral polish and associated striations are in many respects comparable to those obtained experimentally by obliquely percussing fragments of pyrite (FeS2) against the flatter 'faces' of a biface to make fire. The striations are always oriented roughly parallel to the long axis of the tool and are in some cases crosscut by subsequent flake removals, together arguing against a taphonomic origin for these traces. Such a percussive method is effective at regularly producing sparks that are easily directed towards tinder material while leaving the edges of the tool sharp for other tasks. These directional percussive and frictive use wear traces are present on bifacial tools recovered from archaeological layers primarily attributed to the Mousterian of Acheulean Tradition (MTA) technoculture (ca. 50,000 years BP) at multiple sites throughout France. We discuss findings from five of these sites: Chez-Pinaud/Jonzac (Charente-Maritime) and Pech de l’Azé I, Fonseigner, Bout des Vergnes and Meyrals in the Dordogne. The use of bifaces as strike-a-light tools is a technocultural feature shared among the MTA peoples that represents the ‘smoking gun’ attesting to Neandertal fire making capabilities."

AD 1550 and 1650. Due to the enormous success of the compendiario, and the similarity in the ceramic style amongst different European production centers, faience decorated in compendiario faces many attribution problems (Jaspers 2009; 2012b). The Dutch soil revealed a large amount and wide range of maiolica decorated in compendiario. Dozens of them have been positively linked to French production (e.g. Nevers and Rouen), the area of central Italy (e.g.. the cities of Faenza and Deruta), and Southern Italy (e.g. Castelli d’Abruzzo and/or Naples/Salerno). However, there is a broad but unique category of compendiario that belongs to one specific homogeneous stylistic group, which has several authentication problems. In previous literature, it was often incorrectly attributed to a provenance in Faenza, the Italian city that invented the style, or to Haarlem/Delft, because Dutch borders contained the most archaeological examples of this compendiario type. Yet, Nina Jaspers claimed, based on stylistic similarities with other Ligurian productions , that this particular group was produced in Liguria (Albisola and Savona); on the northwestern Italian coast (Jaspers 2007a; 2007b; 2007c; 2009; 2012a, 2012b; 2013). In this research, we tested Jaspers’ hypothesis through chemical analysis with a portable-XRF (pXRF) and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) on the maiolica paste composition. A large dataset of 200 faience samples from archaeological excavations in Amsterdam, Enkhuizen, Hoorn and ceramic reference material from Italy (Liguria, Venice, Faenza, Naples), France (Nevers) and Portugal were analysed. The results of the analysis and the comparison of following elemental ratios: Fe/Sr, Zr/Ti for pXRF and La/Sc; Th/Co; La/Cr; Th/Sc; La/Lu; Y/Tb; V/Sc for ICP-MS, provide solid evidence to connect the unique group of compendiario retrieved from Dutch soil to the Ligurian reference materials. Hence, through the interpretation of the trace and rare earth elements values, we confirmed Jaspers’ hypothesis that the majority of imported compendiario in the Netherlands belongs to Ligurian production, rejecting the previous attributions to a production provenance in Faenza, Haarlem or Delft. Moreover, the results from this analysis demonstrated that faience during the 16th and 17th centuries can be analysed and distinguished by the composition of matrix components either with pXRF, being non-invasive, and with micro-destructive analysis with ICP-MS. This research called for a reconsideration of the European production of compendiario, confuting the previous false attributions, and quantitatively places Ligurian production as one of the most prominent in Europe."

Residual rickets is nonadult vitamin D deficiency still evident in an adult individual, whereas osteomalacia occurs in adulthood. Previous research on the Beemster population, a 19th century rural community in the Netherlands, identified rickets in 30.4% of the nonadults between the ages of two and four years (n =7/23). Because the sex of these nonadults was not known it was not possible to determine if there were differences between boys and girls. To overcome this gap in our knowledge, the aim of this paper is to determine if there are gender related differences in vitamin D deficiency in the Beemster skeletal collection, based on adults with residual rickets and osteomalacia. Out of 200 adults (100 females; 100 males) no cases of osteomalacia were detected. However, there were 29 cases of residual rickets (14.5%), with 21 of those cases in females (21.0%; 21/100).

It closely examines the contents of, and changing editors at, The Philosophical Review, and provides a perspective on the contents of other leading philosophy journals. It suggests that analytic philosophy emerged prior to the 1950s in an environment characterized by a rich diversity of approaches to philosophy and that it came to dominate American philosophy at least in part due to its effective promotion by The Philosophical Review’s editors. Our picture of mid-twentieth-century American philosophy is different from existing ones, including those according to which the prominence of analytic philosophy in America was basically a matter of the natural affinity between American philosophy and analytic philosophy and those according to which the political climate at the time was hostile towards non-analytic approaches. Furthermore, our reconstruction suggests a new perspective on the nature of 1950s analytic philosophy."

The site distribution pattern suggests an ephemeral presence of hominins in the south of Europe from around 1 million years ago onward, with occasional short northward expansions along the western coastal areas when temperate conditions permitted. From around 600,000–700,000 years ago, Acheulean artefacts appear in Europe and somewhat later hominin presence seems to pick up, with more sites and now some also present in colder climatic settings. It is again only later, around 350,000 years ago, that the first sites show up in more continental, central parts of Europe, east of the Rhine. A series of recent papers on the Early Pleistocene palaeontological site of Untermassfeld (Thuringia, Germany) makes claims that are of great interest for studies of earliest Europe and are at odds with the described pattern: the papers suggest that Untermassfeld has yielded stone tools and humanly modified faunal remains, evidence for a 1 million years old hominin presence in European continental mid-latitudes, and additional evidence that hominins were well-established in Europe already around that time period. Here, we evaluate these claims and demonstrate that these studies are severely flawed in terms of data on provenance of the materials studied and in the interpretation of faunal remains and lithics as testifying to a hominin presence at the site. In actual fact, any reference to the Untermassfeld site as an archaeological one is unwarranted. Furthermore, it is not the only European Early Pleistocene site where inferred evidence for hominin presence is problematic. The strength of the spatiotemporal patterns of hominin presence and absence depends on the quality of the data points we work with, and database maintenance, including critical evaluation of new sites, is crucial to advance our knowledge of the expansions and contractions of hominin ranges during the Pleistocene."

Management of MUCH resources, based on Western legal systems, has focused almost exclusively on shipwreck sites. Management strategies have been implemented to stop treasure hunting and limit the damage caused by salvage activities. The application of internationally accepted MUCH management practices has, however, failed to engage the publics of many African nations. This has meant that the application of regulatory strategies has been a challenging task which has ultimately failed to successfully manage MUCH resources or engage sub-Saharan communities. This research proposes, applies and assesses alternative management and engagement models at several southern-African case study sites, and contributes towards establishing a new approach to MUCH. The approach examines the context in which the heritage resource exists, including the socio-political and economic environments, as well as the available mechanisms in place, and available, for research and management. It considers the scope of MUCH in a regional context and seeks to establish some preliminary guidelines for management strategies built on local relevance and buy-in. Finally, it offers a management approach that is beneficial to both professional practitioners and community leaders."

This is a pragmatic approach that appreciates scientific measurements of metal objects as essential empirical evidence whilst recognising that a considerable share of these archaeometric data are inapt or too detailed for an understanding of skill. This empirical approach towards skill is relevant to our knowledge of the role of crafts and materials in the past.

Mostly imports from Central Europe, these objects are found brought together in varying configurations in cremation burials generally known as chieftains’ graves or princely burials. In terms of grave goods they resemble the Fürstengräber of the Hallstatt Culture of Central Europe. Fragmenting the Chieftain presents the results of an in-depth and practice-based archaeological analysis of the Dutch and Belgian elite graves and the burial practice through which they were created. It was established that the elite burials are embedded in the local burial practice, while it appears that those individuals interred with wagons and related items warranted a more elaborate funerary rite, most likely because these ceremonial and cosmologically charged vehicles marked their owners out as exceptional individuals. Furthermore, in a few graves the configuration of the grave good set, the use of textiles to wrap grave goods and the dead and the reuse of burial mounds show the influence of individuals familiar with Hallstatt Culture burial customs."

Much of the remote sensing data acquired in this process potentially holds important information about the location and context of archaeological sites and objects. Archaeology has started to make use of this tremendous potential by developing new approaches for the detection and mapping of archaeological traces based on digital remote sensing data and the associated tools and procedures.

Only slight topographic modifications remain, typically associated with middens. Nonetheless, surface scatters, as well as the soil characteristics they produce, can serve as quantifiable indicators of an archaeological site, detectable by analyzing remote sensing imagery. A variety of pre-processed, very diverse data sets went through a process of image registration, with the intention to combine multispectral bands to feed two different semi-automatic direct detection algorithms: a posterior probability, and a frequentist approach. Two 5 × 5 km2 areas in the northwestern Dominican Republic with diverse environments, having sufficient imagery coverage, and a representative number of known indigenous site locations, served each for one approach. Buffers around the locations of known sites, as well as areas with no likely archaeological evidence were used as samples. The resulting maps offer quantifiable statistical outcomes of locations with similar pixel value combinations as the identified sites, indicating higher probability of archaeological evidence. These still very experimental and rather unvalidated trials, as they have not been subsequently groundtruthed, show variable potential of this method in diverse environments."

In early Islamic times, Tarsus was one of the most important garrison cities on the militarized Arab-Byzantine frontier, from where the Muslims raided into Byzantium. By focusing on the early Islamic phase of the Gözlükule mound through the pottery evidence from this period, this study has sought to trace archaeologically the impact of the Arab occupation in this site. The key question of this thesis was how and to what extent the ceramics of the old Gözlükule excavations could be compared with the production, distribution and consumption of similar pottery finds from other sites of the Abbasid period. Being the first full archaeological discussion of this ceramic corpus, this study has not only shown substantial improvement on previous work but it has also covered an important gap for Islamic archaeology in southern Turkey."

A Latin colony was established here in 291 BC and also other subsequent Roman colonization movements are known from the literary sources. As in many other Roman colonial landscapes, trends in the settlement data of Venusia have previously been linked to the impact of Roman colonization, which is usually understood as a drastic transformation of the pre-Roman settlement landscape and land use. Rather than using theories on Roman colonial strategies for explaining possible settlement patterns (deductive approach), this paper presents an alternative, descriptive, bottom-up approach, and GIS-based inductive location preference analysis to investigate how the settlement landscape evolved in the Hellenistic and Roman periods (particularly in the fourth–first century BC). Following closely the settlement choices from the pre-Roman conquest period onwards and assessing patterns in continuity and change in the settlement record, we demonstrate that pre-Roman rural settlement and land use strategies were not eradicated but instead strongly determined the location preferences for later settlements in the “colonial” periods. If these settlement trends can be related at all to the colonization waves mentioned in the ancient literary sources, the conclusion should be that Roman colonization did not lead to radical landscape and land use transformations, as has traditionally been suggested. Instead, an organic and complementary rural infill over time is documented, in which cultural factors instead of land use potential played a key role."

In this article, using new findings and historical contexts, we argue that the Gallina people had a complicated identity forged around resistance and a deep connection to their past. To better understand them we need to move past previous binary categories used to describe them and perceive them not as isolated or connected, aggressors or victims, traditionalists or innovators, but as an intersectional mix of these axes of identity.La investigación arqueológica sobre los habitantes Gallina (1100–1300 d.

De hecho, han sido escasas las investigaciones que han intentado entender quiénes eran los residentes del Gallina. En este artículo, utilizando nuevos hallazgos y contextos históricos, argumentamos que los grupos Gallina tuvieron una identidad compleja, forjada en torno a la resistencia y a una profunda conexión con su historia.

In order to address subsistence and manufacturing uses of bird bones, we first discuss the recovery process of this unique sample. We proceed to investigate the bones' archaeological contexts as well as the taphonomy in play and analyze diverse bone categories. We found that indigenous peoples consistently targeted several families of birds for food or feathers or both, and that avian bones were used for fashioning tools and adornments. We also discuss possible signatures of island campsite seasonal occupancy as inferred from the bio-ecology of the identified bird taxa. The data suggest that the differentiation of nesting grounds between the Red-footed and Brown Booby in the Southeastern Caribbean may be a result of anthropogenically-induced adaptation. The findings discussed in this paper open challenging avenues for assessing long-term changes in bird communities including the dynamics of resident and wintering bird populations."

Hence, through a brief exploration of Early Bronze Age axes, my aim is to highlight technical skill and use this to reveal different levels of material specialization. On this basis, I suggest moving beyond the umbrella term of ‘specialist’ and using four, more precise analytical units that are better equipped to accommodate the qualitative diversity of material cultures: the amateur, showing basic knowledge but little refinement; the craftsperson, producing well-made practical objects; the master, striving for perfection and setting the norm; and the virtuoso, taking risks in creating original and unique products."

There were no definitive ODin non-pedal elements, yet 12.9% of individuals suffered from pedal OD. Few archaeological and clinical reports specify the prevalence of pedal OD. According to the few that do, the Middenbeemster pedal OD prevalence is distinctly high. Several factors could have contributed to this. First, the rural Beemster community was centered around cattle farming, requiring extensive outside work and animal maintenance; thus, increasing the chances of acute/repetitive trauma in the foot. Second, the footwear worn during that period in the Netherlands was the wooden clog. It is suggested that the hard and inflexible clog, which is poor at absorbingand limits the movement of the foot, could have resulted in repetitive microtrauma.

The main goal of this research was to systematically document the synchronic and diachronic variability in pre-Hispanic material culture found throughout the Mayales River subbasin, particularly in the valley north of Juigalpa, in the department of Chontales. The study started as a full-coverage, high intensity surface survey in a 52 sq km area, as well as the recording of all sites featuring architecture within a 42 sq km subarea. Surface ceramics were mainly found on the riverbanks, while chipped stone presented lower densities distributed uniformly throughout the area, similar to groundstone, which occurred in even lesser quantities. Ceramic and chipped stone distribution and frequency seem to be related to raw material procurement practices rather than the chronological depth of sites with architectural features. In the process, 1,300 mounds were documented during 2015 and 2016. Including the previously registered site of Aguas Buenas, the total of 1,679 mounds was divided in 47 clusters, following specific environmental and material culture patterning. Preliminary results of this study suggest that pre-Hispanic communities in the research area formed a historically complex social landscape"

It is an attempt to interpret human-environmental interaction in order to “read” the relationship between islands, settlements, landscapes and seascapes in the context of the diverse and highly interactive Mediterranean world.It offers an interdisciplinary approach, which combines archaeological evidence, literary sources, and observations of the sites and microlandscapes as a whole, using the advantages offered by the application of new technologies in archaeological research (Geographic Information Systems). The islands of Paros and Naxos are used as case-studies. The author traces how these neighbouring insular communities reacted under the same general circumstances pertaining in the Aegean and to what extent the landscape played a role in this process."

The palynological data show a natural landscape that was unaltered by anthropogenic activity in which a mosaic of vegetation communities existed, each occupying areas that best suited them. Either Mediterranean or more temperate mid-latitude vegetation communities are represented, dependent on the abiotic (e.g. elevation, aspect, geology, edaphic and hydrology) or biotic (e.g. competition) circumstances. The plant macrofossil data and locally derived components of the pollen spectra show that the vegetation in and around the water body was stable. Both data sets indicate that sediment deposition took place in a lacustrine basin. At the point of sampling the water column was probably around 1 m deep and contained clear, calcareous, mesotrophic to eutrophic, slow moving to still fresh water. At the margins of the lake existed a reed swamp, composed of tall and shorter herbs. Evidence for brackish conditions nearby, probably on the beach ridge, is the presence of a small number of halophytic taxa. The palaeobotanical data suggest the deposition of the tephras did not affect the vegetation in the area. Charcoal deposition was probably the result of natural fires burning in the catchment."

This paper presents the use-wear analysis carried out on a sample of seventeen grinding tools from Jiahu, nine of which were previously analyzed for the presence of starch. Use-wear traces associated with processingand wood-like material were identified. This result confirms important evidence of cereal processing in the earlyperiod. It also reveals the diversity of functions in the grinding tool. Furthermore, the use-wear distribution indicates that grindingwithout feet and cylindrical rollers were mainly associated with the processing of cereals while grinding slabs with feet were mainly related to the processing of wood-like material.of the starch data also indicates that grinding slabs without feet possess more starch grains than the grinding slabs with feet. Therefore, it is argued that specific types of grinding tools were used for processing specific kinds of material. This study highlights the different roles grinding tools may have played in early farming societies."

Diet appears to have played a prominent role in their adaptation to Eurasia. Based on isotope and zooarchaeological studies, Neanderthal diet has been reconstructed as heavily meat-based and generally similar across different environments. This image persists, despite recent studies suggesting more plant use and more variation. However, we have only a fragmentary picture of their dietary ecology, and how it may have varied among habitats, because we lack broad and environmentally representative information about their use of plants and other foods. To address the problem, we examined the plant microremains in Neanderthal dental calculus from five archaeological sites representing a variety of environments from the northern Balkans, and the western, central and eastern Mediterranean. The recovered microremains revealed the consumption of a variety of non-animal foods, including starchy plants. Using a modeling approach, we explored the relationships among microremains and environment, while controlling for chronology. In the process, we compared the effectiveness of various diversity metrics and their shortcomings for studying microbotanical remains, which are often morphologically redundant for identification. We developed Minimum Botanical Units as a new way of estimating how many plant types or parts are present in a microbotanical sample. In contrast to some previous work, we found no evidence that plant use is confined to the southern-most areas of Neanderthal distribution. Although interpreting the ecogeographic variation is limited by the incomplete preservation of dietary microremains, it is clear that plant exploitation was a widespread and deeply rooted Neanderthal subsistence strategy, even if they were predominately game hunters. Given the limited dietary variation across Neanderthal range in time and space in both plant and animal food exploitation, we argue that vegetal consumption was a feature of a generally static dietary niche."

Our ability to retrieve DNA from a larger number of Neanderthal individuals has been limited by poor preservation of endogenous DNA and contamination of Neanderthal skeletal remains by large amounts of microbial and present-day human DNA. Here we use hypochlorite treatment of as little as 9 mg of bone or tooth powder to generate between 1- and 2.7-fold genomic coverage of five Neanderthals who lived around 39,000 to 47,000 years ago (that is, late Neanderthals), thereby doubling the number of Neanderthals for which genome sequences are available. Genetic similarity among late Neanderthals is well predicted by their geographical location, and comparison to the genome of an older Neanderthal from the Caucasus indicates that a population turnover is likely to have occurred, either in the Caucasus or throughout Europe, towards the end of Neanderthal history. We find that the bulk of Neanderthal gene flow into early modern humans originated from one or more source populations that diverged from the Neanderthals that were studied here at least 70,000 years ago, but after they split from a previously sequenced Neanderthal from Siberia around 150,000 years ago. Although four of the Neanderthals studied here post-date the putative arrival of early modern humans into Europe, we do not detect any recent gene flow from early modern humans in their ancestry."

Since its inception, Pottery goes Public has been designed to  involve a wider audience not only into the study of ancient potting techniques, but into the very process of carrying out the research. As advocated by the proponents of a reflexive approach to archaeology, in order to make the past relevant to contemporary society it is imperative for the archaeologist to include all interested parties into every stage of the analysis, from the formulation of the research questions to the dissemination of outputs. In this sense, the deployment of modern 3D technologies proved to be an indisputably powerful medium of communication and interaction with the public at large. Performing live archaeological research with cutting edge tools is a key step towards opening up academic research to multiple actors and actively engaging them with the archaeological interpretative process."

In both the European and the indigenous world, a set of economic, political and hierarchical networks and relations were defined, structured and changed. To approach the transformations that took place in the indigenous world a regional archaeological investigation (coast of the Montecristi province, Dominican Republic) was combined with a theoretical framework that integrated: the concepts of taskscape and contested landscapes with statistical analysis and Geographic Information Systems, to evaluate the patterns of material culture distribution and its cultural implications. This allowed indigenous taskscapes to be defined at different spatial scales, which in turn permitted the delineation of the indigenous landscape before the arrival of Columbus. The archaeological results were compared with evidence from the early colonial chronicles and cartography for the north of the island. This comparison highlighted the spatial and material bases for the transformation of the indigenous landscape. The final results were encapsulated by two transformations of the indigenous landscape, called the Everyday Level, and the Imaginary Level."

Cooking vessels of three surveys in different parts of the Pontine Plain and around Norba, in the Lepine foothills, are considered. The considered time-span covers the period in which the Pontine region became integrated in the Roman state until the end of the Republic, and cooking vessels have much to tell us about the region's integration in production and distribution systems, and whether changes occurred therein.The petrographic study shows that the cooking pots were produced and distributed at regional and supra-regional scales. The production and distribution systems that are tentatively inferred show aspects of continuity and change during the time-span considered. Roman cooking vessels that circulated in the Pontine region between the 4th and the 3rd centuries BC had a supra-regional and regional provenance.

The Caribbean region, however, possesses a highly complex isotopic ecology, including both a large number of isotopically variable food sources, and a high degree of isotopic overlap between different food groups. As such, to date, most regional paleodietary studies have been limited to descriptive and qualitative conclusions concerning the relative contributions of different food sources. In this study we apply an iterative Bayesian multi-source mixing model (FRUITS) to skeletal stable isotope data from the prehistoric population of Tutu, St. Thomas, USVI, to test the feasibility of such models to generate quantitative and probabilistic individual paleodietary reconstructions. The isotope data set includes both bone collagen (δ13Cco and δ15Nco) and apatite (δ13Cap) data. The results of two different dietary models using four and five distinct food groupings, respectively, are compared and assessed relative to other relevant archaeological evidence pertaining to past diet at the site. We highlight the potentials and limitations of multi-source mixing models for regional paleodietary studies, and their relevance to ongoing debates within Caribbean archaeology concerning the relative importance of different food sources such as manioc, maize, and seafood."

In particular, stable carbon isotope studies have shown a prevalent C4 component in the diets of most taxa, and grass leaves are the single most abundant C4 resource in African savannas. Grass leaves are typically portrayed as having little nutritional value (e.g., low in protein and high in fiber) for hominins lacking specialized digestive systems. It has also been argued that they present mechanical challenges (i.e., high toughness) for hominins with bunodont dentition. Here, we compare the nutritional and mechanical properties of grass leaves with the plants growing alongside them in African savanna habitats. We also compare grass leaves to the leaves consumed by other hominoids and demonstrate that many, though by no means all, compare favorably with the nutritional and mechanical properties of known primate foods. Our data reveal that grass leaves exhibit tremendous variation and suggest that future reconstructions of hominin dietary ecology take a more nuanced approach when considering grass leaves as a potential hominin dietary resource."

Here we present genome-wide data from 400 Neolithic, Copper Age and Bronze Age Europeans, including 226 individuals associated with Beaker-complex artefacts. We detected limited genetic affinity between Beaker-complex-associated individuals from Iberia and central Europe, and thus exclude migration as an important mechanism of spread between these two regions. However, migration had a key role in the further dissemination of the Beaker complex. We document this phenomenon most clearly in Britain, where the spread of the Beaker complex introduced high levels of steppe-related ancestry and was associated with the replacement of approximately 90% of Britain’s gene pool within a few hundred years, continuing the east-to-west expansion that had brought steppe-related ancestry into central and northern Europe over the previous centuries."

It argues that the regular representation of owls in figurative art and ornamentation in this context must be understood as a result of unique conditions of encounter and interaction emerging at the intersection of Southern Moravian early MIS 2-environments, Pavlovian sociocultural practice, and owl presence and behaviour. It is shown that the diverse and tree-rich environments of East-Central Europe, and the Pavlovian Hill region in particular, provided highly favourable living conditions for a rich owl community. In conjunction with Pavlovian settlement behaviour which produced large-scale aggregation sites and seems to have been associated with a more sedentary mode of life, humans were thus particularly exposed to owls that likely dominated the nightly soundscapes of the region. This coincides with the fact that many of the present owl species are resident birds and aligns with compelling evidence for a pronounced ‘sense of place’ in the region's early Gravettian. The paper therefore suggests considering the saliency of negotiating the owl theme in the Pavlovian as an expression of the general eco-cultural entanglement of humans and owls in this setting. I argue that human-owl relations in the Pavlovian might have ultimately been fashioned by a shared sense of place."

Second, the sample analyzed by Gorin shows contextual bias and lacks sufficient absolute dates. As a result, a comprehensive regional research plan was established to test the current accepted chronology, and redefine it where necessary. In this paper, we present the first date list for the Valley of Juigalpa, Mayales River subbasin (Chontales, Nicaragua). Contrary to Gorin’s proposal, which established a chronology from 500 BC through AD 1600, reports on new seventeen radiocarbon (14C) assays show a cultural sequence from 1420 ± 30 BP, or cal AD 595–660 (±2σ) through the present."

Their importance can be directly linked to an expression of socio-cultural phenomena. To understand the practices and techniques applied in the production of terracotta figurines from Akragas (Agrigento, Sicily), an archaeological experiment was carried out with the aim to reconstruct the full chaîne opératoire. This so-called coroplastic experiment focused on the large variety of female figurines from Akragas dated from the 6th-5th century BC. These form the majority of mould-made objects, which were placed as votives in high numbers at sanctuaries and were also applied as a grave gift. The demand for figurines to be dedicated and the flourishing business of terracotta production in Akragas can be explained by the presence of several nearby high-quality mineral resources, in combination with the craftsmanship of the local workshops. This availability sets the conditions for a strong tradition, resulting in a variety of moulded figurines. In this study, several clays and techniques are selected to re-create the production process with the aim of elucidating the technological capacity and choices made by potters and artisans. The outcome of tests with local clays showed that the materials nearby found fit the workability requirements, but also that by mixing several clays the colour of the figurines could be manipulated. Several generations of a figurine’s genealogy re-created in the experiment show how details fade and explain the common solution to replace the head. The use of different tools, such as round sticks as well as metal blades could be distinguished by an interpretative approach to the traces on reworked figurines. The development of characteristics in both design and technique shows a local style, while moulds and figurines were exchanged with other Sicilian towns, such as Selinous (Selinunte, Sicily). However, the appearance, as well as specific production techniques, shows an influence of a different craft tradition, one which points to an eastern Greek origin. In order to distinguish the technological choices and their effect on stylistic developments, a technical approach was chosen to research the production technique and the use of materials by the workshops in Akragas."

Research to date has focused mainly on industries where MNCs have a direct impact on cultural or archaeological heritage through their operations: for example, in the extractive and construction industries, and the tourism and financial sectors. A cross-industry survey is largely absent, therefore leaving a gap in the knowledge related to private-sector stakeholder engagement with cultural heritage beyond these industries. This research makes a first step to fill this gap by providing a global, cross- sectoral analysis of MNCs’ involvement with cultural heritage. The research brings forward two new findings for the field of cultural heritage management. First, it shows that extensive private-sector involvement with cultural heritage comes from a wider range of sectors than has been previously assumed (namely, the automobile, alcohol, consumer-electronics, and high technology sectors). Second, through case-studies it expands the understanding of the value of cultural heritage for MNCs as a proactive strategy - related for example to the marketing and brand value - rather than as a reactive strategy stemming directly from legal or ethical responsibilities."

71253,How much would each researcher receive if competitive government research funding were distributed equally among researchers?,"Vaesen, K.; Katzav, J.                                                         2017",,Article / Letter to editor,open access,"Scientists are increasingly dissatisfied with funding systems that rely on peer assessment and, accordingly, have suggested several proposals for reform. One of these proposals is to distribute available funds equally among all qualified researchers, with no interference from peer review. Despite its numerous benefits, such egalitarian sharing faces the objection, among others, that it would lead to an unacceptable dilution of resources. The aim of the present paper is to assess this particular objection. We estimate (for the Netherlands, the U.S. and the U.K.) how much researchers would receive were they to get an equal share of the government budgets that are currently allocated through competitive peer assessment. For the Netherlands, we furthermore estimate what researchers would receive were we to differentiate between researchers working in low-cost, intermediate-cost and high-cost disciplines. Given these estimates, we then determine what researchers could afford in terms of PhD students, Postdocs, travel and equipment. According to our results, researchers could, on average, maintain current PhD student and Postdoc employment levels, and still have at their disposal a moderate (the U.K.) to considerable (the Netherlands, U.S.) budget for travel and equipment. This suggests that the worry that egalitarian sharing leads to unacceptable dilution of resources is unjustified. Indeed, our results strongly suggest that there is room for far more egalitarian distribution of funds than happens in the highly competitive funding schemes so prevalent today."

In turn, other starchy plants such as sweet potato ([L.] Lam.) and maize (L.), among others, are consistently recovered and identified in many of the studied manioc-related artifacts. The main goal of this research report is first to replicate and then to qualitatively assess, from a starch grain morphometric analysis, one of the more extended ways of processing and cooking cassava and sweet potato as referred by some ethnohistoric and ethnographic data from lowland South America and the Antilles. It is known that thermal alteration/degradation of starches is one of the destructive mechanisms that could account for the low ubiquity or absence of manioc and other starch sources on archaeological clay griddles. Our results demonstrate that starch grains from both species survive the replicated processing and cooking techniques but at different preservation rates. This work firmly suggests that if ancient processes for preparing cassava or sweet potato tortillas were similar to the ones replicated here, then the cooking of tortillas on clay griddles had little or any direct relationship with the limited ubiquity of ancient manioc starch grains reported elsewhere.

The abilities to precisely control fire temperatures and to manipulate adhesive properties are believed to require advanced mental traits. However, the significance given to adhesive technology in these debates has quickly outgrown our understanding of birch bark tar and its manufacture using aceramic techniques. In this paper, we detail three experimental methods of Palaeolithic tar production ranging from simple to complex. We recorded the fuel, time, materials, temperatures, and tar yield for each method and compared them with the tar known from the Palaeolithic. Our results indicate that it is possible to obtain useful amounts of tar by combining materials and technology already in use by Neandertals. A ceramic container is not required, and temperature ﻿control﻿ need not be as precise as previously thought. However, Neandertals must have been able to recognize certain material properties, such as adhesive tack and viscosity. In this way, they could develop the technology from producing small traces of tar on partially burned bark to techniques capable of manufacturing quantities of tar equal to those found in the Middle Palaeolithi﻿c archaeological record."

Through a review of descriptive and formal visibility studies in Caribbean archaeology, it reveals that the ability of visual properties to affect past human behaviour is frequently evoked but the more complex of these hypotheses are rarely studied formally. To explore such complex hypotheses, the current study applies a range of techniques: total viewsheds, cumulative viewsheds, visual neighbourhood configurations and visibility networks. Experiments were performed to explore the control of seascapes, the functioning of hypothetical smoke signalling networks, the correlation of these visual properties with stylistic similarities of material culture found at sites and the change of visual properties over time. The results of these experiments suggest that only few sites in Eastern Guadeloupe are located in areas that are particularly suitable to visually control possible sea routes for short- and long-distance exchange; that visual control over sea areas was not a factor of importance for the existence of micro-style areas; that during the early phase of the Late Ceramic Age networks per landmass are connected and dense and that they incorporate all sites, a structure that would allow hypothetical smoke signalling networks; and that the visual properties of locations of the late sites Morne Souffleur and Morne Cybèle-1 were not ideal for defensive purposes. These results led us to propose a multi-scalar hypothesis for how lines of sight between settlements in the Lesser Antilles could have structured past human behaviour: short-distance visibility networks represent the structuring of navigation and communication within landmasses, whereas the landmasses themselves served as focal points for regional navigation and interaction. We conclude by emphasising that since our archaeological theories about visual properties usually take a multi-scalar landscape perspective, there is a need for this perspective to be reflected in our formal visibility methods as is made possible by the methods used in this paper."

Both visibility and geomorphological factors need, therefore, to be assessed when patterns of settlement and location preferences are inferred from survey data. Although both factors have been taken into account in a variety of fieldwork projects and studies, their combined effects remain hard to predict. In this paper, we aim to address this issue by presenting a visualization method that helps in evaluating in combination the possible visibility and geomorphological effects in regional, site‐oriented field surveys. Capitalizing on first‐hand data on both archaeology and soil types produced by the recent Leiden University field survey project in the area of Isernia (Roman Aesernia, Central‐Southern Italy), we propose a combined application of statistical tests and geo‐pedological analysis to assess the extent and scale of the main biases possibly affecting the interpretation of the ancient settlement organization. Translating both sets of biases into GIS maps, we indicate the likelihood that negative field survey observations (absence of sites), in specific parts of the landscape, are genuine or rather distorted by biasing factors. The resulting “archaeological detectability” maps allow researchers to formally highlight critical surveyed zones where the recording of evidence is likely unreliable, and thus provide a filter through which archaeologists can calibrate their interpretations of field survey datasets."

Initially, the argument of this dissertation focuses on examining the intellectual tradition among Indigenous Peoples in Mesoamerica after the European invasion of the Americas. As a result of the Spanish colonization of Mesoamerica, Indigenous Peoples in the capital of New Spain continued developing their own intellectual tradition by following two possible paths. One group of indigenous intellectuals decided to continue with their intellectual production outside of the Spanish colonial institutions. A second group of indigenous intellectuals opted for continuing with their intellectual labors under the sponsorship of the colonial authorities. In this way the intellectual tradition of the Nahua people continued during the entire colonial period. However, during the first decades of the 19th century, with the issuing of the Constitution of Cadiz and the independence of New Spain, the indigenous intellectual phenomenon within the established institutions in Mexico City changed dramatically, but it did not cease. This dissertation explores the changes that Nahua intellectuals who worked within colonial institutions in Mexico City experienced during the first decades of independent government, and examines how they continued with their indigenous intellectual tradition."

The fossil record shows that two types of hominins occupied the region during this period—Neandertals and Homo sapiens. Until recently, diagnostic fossil remains were found only at cave sites. Because the two populations in this region left similar material cultural remains, it was impossible to attribute any open-air site to either species. In this study, we present newly discovered fossil remains from intact archaeological layers of the open-air site ‘Ein Qashish, in northern Israel. The hominin remains represent three individuals: EQH1, a nondiagnostic skull fragment; EQH2, an upper right third molar (RM3); and EQH3, lower limb bones of a young Neandertal male. EQH2 and EQH3 constitute the first diagnostic anatomical remains of Neandertals at an open-air site in the Levant. The optically stimulated luminescence ages suggest that Neandertals repeatedly visited ‘Ein Qashish between 70 and 60 ka. The discovery of Neandertals at open-air sites during the late MP reinforces the view that Neandertals were a resilient population in the Levant shortly before Upper Palaeolithic Homo sapiens populated the region."

However, malaria is only rarely included in archaeological discussions about past Dutch disease, most likely because it does not result in any pathognomonic skeletal lesions. Since anaemia is one of the main symptoms of malaria, cribra orbitalia could be formed in response to the disease. Currently, these orbital lesions are often used in osteoarchaeological research as a non-specific stress marker. However, if malaria can be responsible as well, as suggested by Gowland and Western (2012) for England, interpretations of cribra orbitalia in Dutch research are incomplete and need to be reconsidered. Therefore, this paper will analyse the relationship between cribra orbitalia and marshy areas in the medieval Netherlands to investigate if malaria is likely to have been a causative agent. To do this, cribra orbitalia prevalence is studied in three skeletal collections and supplemented by data published in osteological reports (total: n=1838), which are then linked to geological characteristics. Results indicate a significant correlation (p=<0.001) between the orbital pathology and areas that are deemed malarial, suggesting that malaria was an important illness in these regions of The Netherlands. The results of this poster illustrate the potential limitations of using cribra orbitalia as a non-specific stress marker and demonstrate that combining archaeological context with osteological data can be a way forward in research into the true causative agents of markers of non-specific stress."

During this period several “transitional” technocomplexes are present that seem to combine behavioural characteristics from both the preceding Middle and following Upper Palaeolithic. These technocomplexes therefore play a critical role in our understanding of Neanderthal behavior, cognition and extinction, the dispersal of AMHs into Europe, and the interactions between Neanderthals and AMHs. Unfortunately, biological remains of the hominins responsible for the transitional technocomplexes are notoriously scarce. This dissertation proposes to utilize recent advances in mass spectrometry to identify additional hominin specimens through ZooMS screening and shotgun proteomics. Novel approaches towards de novo/error-tolerant proteomic analysis in Pleistocene contexts were developed and tested, allowing phylogenetic analysis of ancient protein sequences from now-extinct Mammalian species and hominin populations. ZooMS screening is shown to be highly successful for all included Châtelperronian sites. The discovery of additional hominin specimens at one archaeological site allowed demonstrating that ancient protein sequences can be used to differentiate between hominin populations, in this case indicating a Neanderthal affiliation. As a result, palaeoproteomics now allows studying the evolutionary relationships between hominin individuals based on ancient protein sequences."

Facing Society studies indigenous identities through head shaping practices against the backdrop of broader social developments in Caribbean communities before and after 1492 through a multi-disciplinary approach combining archaeology, (ethno)history, anthropology, and sociology.  The first evidence of intentional cranial modification comes from the Early Ceramic Age, however by the Late Ceramic Age it was found across the Caribbean. Different regional patterns emerge in conjunction with diverging social developments. For example, the relatively homogeneous pattern of cranial modification seen in the Greater Antilles indicates a collective identity fostering social cohesion in expanding communities and connecting distant villages within the interaction sphere. The Early Colonial Period was transformative for indigenous communities and identities, and consequently caused a decline in head shaping practices. An unexpected revival was seen among the Black Carib, a community of free African descendants on St. Vincent. Traces of head shaping practices can still be found to this day demonstrating the lasting importance of indigenous social practices in the cultural mosaic of the current Caribbean."

The graves were often reopened at a later time to examine and manipulate their contents. Archaeologists frequently interpret this phenomena as grave robbery, an economically motivated criminal practice. But many aspects of the graves in question do not align with this hypothesis. Martine van Haperen studied over 1300 graves from 11 cemeteries in the Netherlands and Belgium with surprising results. It became clear that the diggers left many objects behind in the reopening pits and prioritized men’s graves even though these contained fewer valuable materials. Instead, they focused on removing object types with crucial symbolic roles in the funerary ritual and early medieval society at large. The high percentage of reopened graves (41%) suggests this was a socially accepted practice. Van Haperen therefore argues that reopenings were part of the normal interactions between the living and the dead, for instance in the form of an ancestor relic cult and as a way of dealing with unquiet dead."

Using targeted enrichment of mitochondrial DNA, we show that cave sediments represent a rich source of ancient mammalian DNA that often includes traces of hominin DNA, even at sites and in layers where no hominin remains have been discovered. By automation-assisted screening of numerous sediment samples, we detected Neandertal DNA in eight archaeological layers from four caves in Eurasia. In Denisova Cave, we retrieved Denisovan DNA in a Middle Pleistocene layer near the bottom of the stratigraphy. Our work opens the possibility of detecting the presence of hominin groups at sites and in areas where no skeletal remains are found."

Dogs have accompanied humans as they colonised much of the world, and were introduced via human agency into the insular Caribbean where they became widespread throughout the Ceramic Age. It is likely that the dynamic interactions between humans, dogs, and their environments in the Caribbean were spatially, chronologically, and socially variable. However, almost no research has specifically addressed the nature, or potential variability, of human/dog interactions in this region. This study presents isotopic (strontium and carbon) evidence bearing on human and dog paleomobility and paleodietary patterns in the pre-colonial Caribbean. The isotope results illustrate a generally high degree of correspondence between human and dog dietary practices at all analysed sites but also slight differences in the relative importance of different dietary inputs. Striking parallels are also observed between the human and dog mobility patterns and shed light on broader networks of social interaction and exchange. Lastly, the paper addresses the possible utility and relevance of canine isotope data as proxies for inferring past human behaviours."

To obtain a balanced reconstruction, we analyse the large molluscs separately from the so-called incidentals, the small mollusc species. Based on modern mollusc habitat preferences and tolerances we identify four different eco-profiles to help characterise sea surface temperatures and the character of the shore: temperature profile; geographical distribution; substrate; wave interaction. We hypothesise that changes in the Klasies River mollusc community/eco-profiles can be linked to global glacial and interglacial events and we define several testable assumptions. We found that in response to global warming and cooling events, the Klasies River mollusc communities change slightly, yet significantly. Other sources of marine environmental data confirm that average sea surface temperatures gradually decreased, but probably remained within the modern southern east coast range of variation. It appears that coastal sea surface temperatures of the warm Agulhas current were not particularly depressed during the occupation sequence. The character of the coastal topography does change more apparently during the occupation sequence of the sites and with it the mollusc assemblages: from an interglacial rocky shore in the Klasies and two Mossel Bay phases to a more glacial sandy environment during the Howiesons Poort and the MSA III. In conclusion, the temperature tolerance levels of many Klasies River mollusc species are too broad to reflect small changes in sea surface temperatures. However, in conjunction with other eco-profiles and environmental proxies, such as substrate requirements and oxygen isotopes, the temperature approximations are useful, particularly when evaluating large scale sea surface temperature fluctuations. For the characterisation of the shore and substrate we found the eco-profile approach very useful."

They reflect long-distance connections in material culture and elite (burial) practices across the breadth of Northwest and Central Europe. Research into this period, however, tends to be regionally focused and poorly accessible to scholars from other areas – language barriers in particular are a hindering factor.In an attempt to overcome this, Connecting Elites and Regions brings together scholars from several research traditions and nations who present regional overviews and discussions of elite burials and material culture from all over Northwest and Central Europe.

Variability in the production and preservation of anthropogenic fire traces can potentially skew our perception of fire use in the past. With this in mind, the research presented in this article weighs in on the debate concerning Neandertal fire use and fire making, specifically, the assertion that Neandertals were unable to produce fire for themselves (Sandgathe et al., 2011a, 2011b). This hypothesis is based on the inferred correlation between climatic deterioration, concurrent lowering of lightning-ignited fire frequencies, and reduced signals for fire use in layers presumably deposited during the Lower Pleniglacial (Marine Isotope Stage 4) at the Middle Palaeolithic sites of Roc de Marsal and Pech de l’Azé IV (Aquitaine Basin, southwestern France), the logic being that if Neandertals could produce fire at will, fire use signals would remain largely consistent throughout the deposits despite there being limited access to natural fires in the landscape during this colder period. This review challenges these assertions at multiple scales by looking at regional lightning and fire regime dynamics, comparing the fire signals observed at Roc de Marsal and Pech de l’Azé IV to those of other sites nearby and around France, and exploring the various environmental and cultural factors likely influencing these signals. Ultimately, the data suggests that estimated reductions in lightning frequencies and fire regime during the Lower Pleniglacial (and colder stadial periods, in general) were not adequate to severely limit Neandertal access to natural fire, while possible artefactual evidence for Neandertal fire making challenges the assumption that they were at all reliant on lightning-ignited fire. Moreover, at the nearby Neandertal site of Combe Grenal, the majority of the layers exhibiting evidence of fire use have cold climatic signals, suggesting the fire use trends observed at Roc de Marsal and Pech de l’Azé IV are potentially local expressions of changes in regional site use patterns, possibly brought on by increased reliance on highly mobile, migratory reindeer prey species and reductions in local woodfuel availability during cold periods. Other factors potentially reducing the archaeological visibility of cold climate fire use are discussed."

It is thus among the latest records of this species. To explore the evolutionary and natural history of this relatively unknown animal, we performed morphological, dietary, and genetic analyses.

The role of this colonial heritage in defining contemporary Caribbean identities has been significant. Nevertheless, the indigenous peoples who inhabited the Caribbean in the past are not frequently referred to in modern-day Caribbean society. It is often believed that the indigenous inhabitants were wiped out soon after European arrival, yet recent archaeological and ethnographic studies have shown the survival of indigenous traditions and expressions in the present Caribbean. There is an indigenous resurgence movement among groups that self-identify with their Amerindian ancestors, and in Dominica the contemporary indigenous population has been officially recognized by the country’s government. These important aspects of Caribbean history are highly relevant for the teaching of the national identity and cultural heritage, and need to be reflected in the school curricula of Social Studies across the region. This paper examines current educational practices regarding indigenous history and heritage in two Caribbean countries, each with a different historical background and development. The first study area lies in the northwest of the Dominican Republic, where Columbus encountered the so-called Taíno in 1492 and founded the first European settlements. The second study area is the Kalinago Territory in Dominica, home of the descendants of the Kalinago indigenous people. The teaching of indigenous history and heritage in the schools of these countries includes the pre-Columbian and colonization periods, reflecting the prevalence of traditional Euro-centered narratives in which the indigenous history ended with the Amerindian “extinction” in past centuries. Contemporary issues receive little or no attention in the curricula."

The debate surrounding these questions can be traced back to two art historians, Elisabeth Neurdenburg and Juliane Gabriels. This article provides a response to Frits Scholten’s article on the subject in Bulletin KNOB no. 1, 2017, a few additions to my own article in Bulletin KNOB no. 2, 2016, and a conclusion about the art-historical context of the attribution of the Dolhuisvrouw. Scholten, who is in agreement with Gabriels’ 1930 monograph, Artus Quellien, de Oude ‘Kunstryck belthouwer’, quotes part of her argumentation and fully endorses her attribution of the Dolhuisvrouw to Artus Quellinus. However, Scholten fails to mention a crucial footnote in a later article by Neurdenburg in the 1943 Oudheidkundig Jaarboek, in which Gabriels declares that she now supports the statue’s attribution to Hendrick de Keyser. Various earlier authors have linked the appearance of the Dolhuisvrouw to a renovation in 1615, and thus to the working life of Hendrick de Keyser. Such an early date seems unlikely because the Dolhuisvrouw is absent from a meticulous map drawn in 1625 by Balthasar Floris, which shows the divided courtyard minus the statue. In the context of this debate, it is important to consider the work of Gerrit Lambertsen, Hendrick de Keyser’s pupil. Apart from a test piece in wood, Lambertsen worked exclusively in sandstone, without signing his work. Although the Dolhuisvrouw has a smooth finish, the plinth exhibits the typical input of a stone mason – of someone who is familiar with sandstone. A reference to styles proves to be of little direct use in arriving at a more accurate dating of the Dolhuisvrouw. Nowadays there are better arguments for dating the statue to the first half of the seventeenth century. Owing to a Calvinist prohibition on licentious nudity, it is likely that the statue initially stood indoors, but historical clues have been discovered that for the time being support Gerrit Lambertsen’s authorship in the second quarter of the century. For an older generation of art historians, form was all-decisive and some did not even mention material and finish. The great masters of the seventeenth century did indeed work in various materials or sought out other specialists to have their works realized in bronze or terracotta. Hendrik de Keyser and his pupil Gerrit Lambertsen both had their own workshops at different points in time, but had a lot in common in terms of origins, style and technique. This was acknowledged by Neurdenburg, as was the comparable relationship between the younger baroque sculptors from the southern Netherlands, Artus Quellinus and Rombout Verhulst. As in painting, older generations of art historians carried out pioneering work, but they looked for ‘geniuses’ in a much too small pool of talent. With selective quotations and attributions Scholten is himself continuing to contribute to what he calls ‘a stubborn misunderstanding’ requiring correction and qualification."

We were very surprised when a dredged channel (110 x 32m) with quay installations consisting of two successive periods of driven piles was uncovered. An immense quantity of portable finds – especially pottery – was retrieved from this channel. The provenances in combination with the form and function of the retrieved pottery make clear that the settlement played a role in trade and military supplies. At first there seems to be a British connection by means of retrieved Romano-British artefacts in Voorburg. Next to that there are some striking resemblances between the Roman harbours of Voorburg-Arentsburg and London when comparing the origin of pottery and several formation processes. Secondly, the pottery provenances and the form and function of the retrieved ware show that the harbour of Voorburg played an important role in supplying the regional coastal forts in the C2nd and C3rd."

Several critical questions arise from a humanitarian situation where the needs are assessed: we have to know what people need and what they don’t need. We need to determine coping mech- anisms that need not substituted but rather facilitated. To not undermine and further marginal- ize we need to know what resources, skills and social capital East African pastoralists have and how they are activated, where and when. The discussion is organized in observations from on one hand, archaeological and heritage perspective and on the other, personal experience of refugees and IDP life in the East Africa. It concludes that people do not only need food and shelter to survive and that cultural heritage is a basic human need too. Without the traditional skills and coping mechanisms that are inherent in the cultural values that glue people together, it is difficult for East African pastoralists to survive. Violence and neglect against people and environment are related to the destruction and neglect of cultural and natural heritage, which are people’s means of livelihood and sources of identity and dignity."

Here we apply ZooMS screening of Châtelperronian and Early Holocene bone specimens from Quinçay, France, to explore temporal and spatial variation in glutamine deamidation. Our results indicate that chronological resolution is low, while spatial variation is high. Nevertheless, our analysis allows the identification of bone specimens that have undergone diagenetic histories remarkably different (either in length or in type) from spatially related bone specimens. Therefore, ZooMS ammonium-bicarbonate screening is capable of testing bone assemblage homogeneity, which could guide subsequent analysis and interpretation."

Baanashada is aimed at women whose fertility issues are believed to be caused by spirits. The study also explores a component of the Baanashada, namely, the use of tiire (Rotheca myricoides), or the butterfly bush. Although Rotheca myricoides is known to possess a number of medicinal components as confirmed by studies of modern science, so far, there exist no studies on its potential (or lack of) fertility effects. Hence, the alleged fertility benefits of the butterfly bush need examining. The author is aware of at least one recent case that a Somali woman from Europe died of herbs placed in her cervix by a traditional healer in Somaliland. This piece of information indicated not only the role of herbal medicine in fertility practices, but also the popularity of traditional reproductive medicine beyond border, class or educational background. Yet, current research into Somali women's health focuses mainly on Female Genital Mutilation (FGM), examined often without the context of wider cultural practices. This paper, however, suggests that rituals, beliefs and material culture play a paramount role in women's practices. For example, as explored elsewhere, the wagar, a wooden and sacred object made of the African olive, is critical for fertility practices. The current paper illuminates further the significance of reproduction practices in Somali society and the potential continuity of traditions associated with the perpetuation of kinship. It concludes that fertility rituals are part of a wider context of interaction with sacred landscapes, objects and archaeological sites, often associated with past legends in the Horn of Africa."

Starting from a novel focus on the materials and materiality of a selection of stone Aegyptiaca from Rome, and by combining archaeological and archaeometric perspectives, this study shows that, while Egyptianness may have been among Roman associations, these objects were able to do much more than merely representing notions of Egypt."

It then discusses the regulations and laws which may have direct impact on not only the built heritage but also the life of local lineage society. It criticizes the harsh control of the local government over local people’s built heritage and their environment in the name of heritage preservation. It then moves on to examine the roles of different stakeholders in the heritage framework concerning the use of local people’s built heritage. It explores the possibility of reaching equilibrium among all the heritage players in the form of contracts, and offers some suggestions to the stakeholders getting involved in the tulou management issues."

This model envisaged settlement sites situated on creek ridges in an open almost treeless landscape. After a sudden change in climate c. 800 cal BC parts of the landscape were inundated, peat bogs developed and West-Frisia was abandoned by man. It was widely believed that this densely inhabited Bronze Age landscape was almost completely destroyed during the land consolidation projects. At the start of this century, however, it turned out that well preserved Bronze Age settlement sites still exist in West-Frisia. These sites were not only well-preserved but also situated at unexpected locations.  In this thesis the palaeogegraphy is described at three scale levels. Based on an analysis of excavation results and environmental proxy data, a new model for the development of the landscape and habitation of West-Frisia during the Bronze Age emerges. For the construction of the palaeogeographical maps of Westwoud, a new approach is used, based on, amongst others, macro botanical remains. The thesis concludes with an alternative strategy for the prospection of Bronze Age sites in West-Frisia."

Race, class, and gender serve as facets and vectors for ideology. By viewing them as processes, their capacity to express such through their social and material environments inextricably tied to their particular temporal and spatial contexts. Through comparisons of the social and material environments of multiple, contemporaneous social contexts within Saba, common social and material vectors among these ideological facets can become apparent. In particular, this concerns:  • How tensions between the “incomplete hegemony” of colonial authorities and plantation agriculture with Saban residents resulted in a dialectic between local landscapes, materiality, and ideologies of race, class, and gender. • Differentiating between slavery, free poverty, and low class in the archaeological record. • The dialectic between scale, locality, and perspective in defining and situating class and poverty."

However this phase is recognised in the archaeological record solely through the documentation of bifacial stone points (artefacts) that have a specific and complex overall morphology. Variability within this phase, and the accuracy with which the limits of it can be identified in time and in space, has received relatively little to no attention. The purpose of my thesis was to develop an objective and reliable method for identifying and interpreting morphological variability in bifacial points from the key Still Bay assemblages, and further, to test patterns documented with this method against conventional understandings of the phase. The broader central findings suggest that Still Bay point morphology varies significantly but uniformly through time, and discretely across space between bifacial point regional groupings. Therefore, treatment of the Still Bay as a culturally homogeneous entity and marker of demographic affiliation may be unreliable in a broader regional context."

Non-destructive characterization of granitoid statues through macroscopic methodologies and in situ XRF analysis,"Müskens, S.; Braekmans, D.; Versluys, M.J.; Degryse, P.                                                         2017",,Article / Letter to editor,open access,"-like Domitian’s obelisk is now decorating Bernini’s fountain on Piazza Navona or the Egyptian lions flanking Michelangelo’s stairs towards the Capitol figure prominently amidst Rome’s cultural heritage. Motivations for the import, contextualization, and copying of these objects during the Imperial Roman period are as heavily debated as they are ill understood. Provenance determination plays an important role in these discussions in terms of a (supposed) dichotomy between(real) versus(copy) but has only been applied stylistically and never been tested analytically. A scientific characterization of the materials themselves is even lacking altogether, as is an investigation into the cultural and symbolic meaning of the materials used. This paper is a first attempt to address these important lacunae on the basis of an explorative study of a selected sample of Egyptian statues from Rome. The identification and provenance attribution of the materials used for these statues are often problematic due to their relatively fine-grained nature and dark color. Therefore, a full non-destructive analysis of Egyptian statues in dark-colored rocks is presented in this study, with the stones evaluated by macroscopic examination and handheld X-ray fluorescence (XRF) analysis. The implemented methodology has allowed a distinction between greywacke and several varieties of granitoid rocks. In order to evaluate the potential for source attribution, a comparison was made between the results of our analyses and geochemical data for several granitoid rocks from Egypt. This has suggested Aswan as most likely source. The results presented here indicate that handheld XRF analysis can be used for the assessment of compositional variability in and potentially for the provenance of granitoid rocks, provided that a fine-grained area of the material can be measured on multiple locations, and if these values can be assessed on (in)consistencies with other published reference materials."

Its heyday was during the Roman Period, when it appears almost bound to Roman presence along and south of the(fig. 3B). During the Early Middle Ages spelt lost importance, but the cereal did not disappear until the late 19th century. In historical times it was mainly used for brewing beer.

Here, we present preliminary ancient DNA data on archaeological canids recovered from FM Ranch (EfPk-1) and Cluny (EePf-1) in Alberta, as well as fromLake Midden (EfNg-1) in Saskatchewan.

Cross-sectional properties of the femoral and tibial midshaft are determined to investigate variation in lower limb mechanical loading. All populations had comparable age ranges. Rural Middenbeemster males had significantly more elliptically shaped tibiae compared to the other populations. Rural males from Klaaskinderkerke had significantly greater femoral cross-sectional area and torsional rigidity compared to females. In the tibia, the males from both rural populations had greater torsional rigidity and cross-sectional area compared to females. In the rural Middenbeemster population the males also had significantly more elliptically shaped tibiae compared to females. While no sexual dimorphism was found in the urban Alkmaar, significantly greater variation in lower limb cross-sectional properties was found for both males and females relative to the rural populations. These results conform to predictions based on the historical literature of greater lower limb loading in rural males compared to females as well as a greater variety of tasks performed in urban environments. The lack of significant differences in lower limb torsional rigidity or shape between populations in either sex suggests that rural life was not necessarily more physically strenuous than urban life in pre-industrial Dutch populations. However, variation in sexual dimorphism suggests that labor between males and females was differently organized in the rural and urban samples."

In this paper the regional and site-oriented field survey conducted in Venosa (Basilicata, Italy) is used as a case-study to simulate a large amount of hypothetical early colonial sites. The aim of this theoretical exercise is to show how the rural dispersed settlement pattern expected by the conventional theory could appear on a map, and to visually highlight the divergence between survey data and conventional spatial expectancies."

Focusing on ancient Nubia after the decline of the colonial Egyptian New Kingdom Empire, we examine musculoskeletal activity patterns (entheseal changes) and traumatic injury in remains uncovered at Tombos, a cemetery at the Third Cataract of the Nile. We find evidence that entheseal changes increased at Tombos from the New Kingdom Period to the postcolonial Third Intermediate/Napatan Periods; however, accidental trauma does not significantly increase between the two periods. With regard to the elevated entheseal changes, we suggest that Nubians may have been engaged in quarrying, agropastoralism, and construction efforts. Furthermore, there is evidence to suggest that this population was biologically resilient, which may have limited accidental/occupational traumatic injury. We view these changes to the Tombos quotidian experience from an agent-centered perspective; we posit that during the postcolonial period, Nubians revitalized their sociopolitical and economic systems through these everyday practices, which contributed to the independent and powerful Napatan state."

The purpose of my dissertation was to examine how wild African tubers, which are targeted by the Hadza hunter-gatherers of Tanzania, contribute the nutritional elements that are essential for health and survival in the East African mosaic environment. To accomplish this objective, I conducted three projects. First, I tested the efficacy of brief roasting, used by the Hadza, on starch gelatinization. Second, I submitted four species of Hadza tubers to an in-vitro simulation of the gastro-intestinal tract, and measured the bioaccessibility of glucose from digestion. Finally, I led an analysis of the Hadza gut microbiome to explore the polysaccharide degrading potential of mutualistic microbiota and learn whether Hadza may be better provisioned by metabolites from fermentation of the residual indigestible plant fibers in their diet."

The absence of attention for women's issues is due to a lack of awareness and knowledge regarding the role women play in society and in the development of communities, and it illustrates the subordinated position women continue to have in society in general. This research wants to contribute to the visibility of indigenous women. Therefore, it provides an overview of some of the challenges indigenous women are still facing, focusing on the case of Mexico. It analyzes the position of indigenous women in Mexican society, to identify some of the fields in which indigenous women's rights are still not guaranteed and therefore require more action.

Moreover, they are excellent archives that allowfor high-resolution environmental, chronological and archaeological analyses. However, these deposits are often subject to complex formation and postdepositional factors, including water-related processes. Evaluating the influence of hydrological processes in site formation is thus essential to more accurately reconstruct the duration, intensity and types of hominin behaviour within these environments. In this paper we present the orientation analysis of archaeological material from the Last Interglacial site Neumark-Nord 2, Germany. Orientation analysis was done using GIS to calculate the orientation of artefact from digital plans of the excavation surface, which were subsequently tested using circular statistics. The results of the orientation analysis are compared with a hydrological model to check the relation between preferred orientations and reconstructed areas of water flow and accumulation. Results suggest that low-energy hydrological processes could have affected certain areas of the find-bearing deposits at Neumark-Nord 2 but, overall, there is no evidence for either high-energy hydrological processes or a significant movement of parts of the archaeological assemblage."

The composition of the brooches was measured with a Hand Held-XRF device and the results showed a sharp deviation from the alloys seen in brooches from earlier periods. The results across all geographic areas consisted of a mixture of copper, zinc and lead, but no tin. If recycling practices were present in the making of these brooches, then you might expect an element of tin to enter the mixture, as bronze items entered the alloy-recycling stream. But this appears not to be the case. This consistency rules out production by travelling merchants, or at domestic households and primitive workshops. The results suggest that production was more likely organised on a regional or even super regional scale. An analysis of production at royal estates, emporia and the great abbeys found the latter to be the most likely source of these objects.  Furthermore, the Christian nature of these brooches, if produced within monastic centres, may have imbued them with religious meaning, allow for a fresh interpretation of their methods of exchange."

This study reports about prehistoric fire incidents and their impact on the flora and vegetation near the village of Ardez in the Lower Engadine Valley (Switzerland) since the Late Neolithic Period. Pollen, charcoal particles and non-pollen palynomorphs preserved in the Saglias and Cutüra peat bog stratigraphies were quantified and the results compared with the regional archaeological evidence. Anthropogenic deforestation using fire started around 4850 cal. BP at Saglias and aimed at establishing first cultivated crop fields (e.g. cereals) and small pastoral areas as implied by the positive correlation coefficients between charcoal particles and cultural and pastoral pollen indicators, as well as spores of coprophilous fungi. Pressure on the natural environment by humans and livestock continued until 3650 cal. BP and was followed by reforestation processes until 3400 cal. BP because of climatic deterioration. Thereafter, a new, continuous cultivation/pastoral phase was recorded for the Middle to Late Bronze Age (3400–2800 cal. BP). After rather minor human impact during the Iron Age and Roman Period, intensive agriculture was recorded for the Medieval Period. The area around Ardez was used for crop cultivation from about 1000 cal. BP until the start of the ‘Little Ice Age’ (600 cal. BP). Despite a land-use reorganisation, the following gradual decrease in agricultural activities led to the extant mixture of a cultivated, grazed and forested landscape in the Lower Engadine. In addition, this study demonstrates the excellent value of the fungus Gelasinospora as a highly local marker of past and today’s fire incidents, as well as of the use of micro-charcoals from pollen slides and macro-charcoals (>150 µm) from pollen sample residues for the reconstruction of short- and long-term fire histories."

This case study presents the macroscopic charcoal record of the Neumark-Nord 2 basin, Germany, and the correlation of this record with the distinct find levels of the basin margin that also contain thermally altered archaeological material. Increased charcoal quantities are shown to correspond to phases of hominin presence—a pattern that fits best with recurrent anthropogenic fires within the watershed.

Paleoecological analyses of these records enable reconstruction of the changing economic and cultural management of heaths and the consequences for landscape and soils. Heaths are characteristic components of cultural landscape mosaics on sandy soils in the Netherlands. The natural habitat of heather species was moorland. At first, natural events like forest fires and storms caused small-scale forest degradation; in addition on that, the forest degradation accelerated due to cultural activities like forest grazing, wood cutting, and shifting cultivation. Heather plants invaded degraded forest soils, and heaths developed. People learned to use the heaths for economic and cultural purposes. The impact of the heath management on landscape and soils was registered in soil records of barrows, drift sand sequences, and plaggic Anthrosols. Based on pollen diagrams of such records we could reconstruct that heaths were developed and used for cattle grazing before the Bronze Age. During the late Neolithic, the Bronze Age, and Iron Age, people created the barrow landscape on the ancestral heaths. After the Iron Age, people probably continued with cattle grazing on the heaths and plaggic agriculture until the early Middle Ages. Severe forest degradation by the production of charcoal for melting iron during the Iron Age till the 6th–7th century and during the 11th–13th century for the trade of wood resulted in extensive sand drifting, a threat to the valuable heaths. The introduction of the deep, stable economy and heath sods digging in the course of the 18th century resulted in acceleration of the rise of plaggic horizons, severe heath degradation, and again extension of sand drifting. At the end of the 19th century heath lost its economic value due to the introduction of chemical fertilizers. The heaths were transformed into ""new"" arable fields and forests, and due to deep ploughing most soil archives were destroyed. Since AD 1980, the remaining relicts of the ancestral heaths are preserved and restored in the frame of the programs to improve the regional and national geo-biodiversity. Despite the realization of many heath restoration projects during the last decades, the area of the present heaths is just a fraction of the heath areal in AD 1900."

Een vergelijkbare ontwikkeling is in Nederland nog niet op gang gekomen, waardoor onze kennis van de productie en het gebruik van textiel voornamelijk is afgeleid van wat er uit de ons omringende landen bekend is. Dit is jammer want er zijn naast kleding bijna geen andere objecten te bedenken die nauwer verwant zijn met de mensen wiens verleden archeologen proberen te ontrafelen. Kleding is namelijk niet alleen functioneel, maar geeft vaak uitdrukking aan de identiteit of sociale positie van degene die de kleding draagt.  In deze studie is onderzoek gedaan naar het gebruik van textiel en kleding in het gebied dat we nu definiëren als Nederland in de periode van 400 tot 1000 AD. Hiervoor zijn weefselresten geanalyseerd die afkomstig zijn van zowel nederzettingen als grafvelden uit verschillende delen van het land. Dit resulteert in een gevarieerd beeld van het gebruik van textiel in deze periode.  Het was mogelijk om in grote lijnen te reconstrueren hoe mensen in de vroege middeleeuwen in het graf gekleed waren.

These structures are usually of approximately rectangular shape and appear in images as faint fragmented contours in complex background. We address this problem by introducing a rectangularity feature that quantifies the degree of alignment of an optimal subset of extracted linear segments with a contour of rectangular shape. The rectangularity feature has high values not only for perfectly regular enclosures but also for ruined ones with distorted angles, fragmented walls, or even a completely missing wall. Furthermore, it has a zero value for spurious structures with less than three sides of a perceivable rectangle. We show how the detection performance can be improved by learning a linear combination of the rectangularity and size features from just a few available representative examples and a large number of negatives. Our approach allowed detection of enclosures in the Silvretta Alps that were previously unknown. A comparative performance analysis is provided. Among other features, our comparison includes the state-of-the-art features that were generated by pretrained deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The deep CNN features, although learned from a very different type of images, provided the basic ability to capture the visual concept of the LEs. However, our handcrafted rectangularity-size features showed considerably higher performance."

In doing so, it shows that these references vary greatly, are context-dependent, and cannot be rightly understood when interpreted only within the normative and fixated frameworks of negative perceptions of contemporary Egypt or positive perceptions of Egypt’s antiquity. Moreover, this study suggests that approaching Roman literary references from the notion of Roman self-representationis useful for understanding and explaining their multifarious and sometimes contradictory messages. This observation does not imply that every reference to Egypt is therefore ‘Roman’. On the contrary, Egypt was occasionally framed as the Other. Yet the omnipresence of Egypt in Roman literature is of major importance when the Roman identity is at stake. Egypt, then, is neither only the Other, nor only the Self, but always a polyvalent notion in terms of identity-making."

In a brief period of time, this region went from being scarcely populated to an area characterised by expanding urban centres and flourishing trade systems. These large scale developments had an impact on the daily lives of medieval people. Focusing on several skeletal indicators of disease, activity, and diet, this research has studied the physical consequences of medieval socioeconomic developments from a hitherto unexplored perspective.  Although differences are observed between the skeletal collections, the key finding is the absence of a marked distinction between town and country. The noted variations in skeletal indicators of disease, activity, and diet are minor and do not support the traditional idea that towns and villages in medieval Holland and Zeeland had become worlds apart. While urban living is frequently associated with negative consequences, this is not supported by this research. Especially in terms of disease, a more nuanced view is necessary. While the risks appear to have been different, one living environment cannot be considered better than the other."

A narrow dietary niche at the top of the terrestrial food chain is inherently prone to instability, potentially contributing to extinction of the Neanderthals. However, limitations in detecting plant consumption imply that scientists are unaware of much of Neanderthal diet. My dissertation revises the role of plants in Neanderthal subsistence using dental calculus, a material that is recognised to contain food traces, as a source of dietary data. To do this I assessed how accurately calculus records diet, by testing it with a variety of techniques on a population of chimpanzees with decades of documented dietary history. Then, my dissertation examined if it is possible to explore the resilience of the Neanderthal dietary niche by assessing for changes in plant use over time. Comparing diets from different habitats, data suggests a broad range of diets on the Mediterranean rim and in the cooler areas of the Neanderthal range. Surprisingly, the study found no evidence of changes in plant dietary breadth despite variation in environments. This stability implies a deeply resilient ecological niche across their range."

Critics have stressed the superiority of human vision and the irreplaceability of human judgement in recognising archaeological traces, perceiving a threat that will undermine professional expertise and that archaeological experience and knowledge could be written out of the interpretative process (e.g. Hanson 2008, 2010; Palmer & Cowley 2010; Parcak 2009). Uneasiness amongst some archaeologists of losing control, even partially, of the interpretation process certainly seems to be a significant factor in criticisms, citing the undeniable fact that archaeological remains (or proxies for those remains) can assume a near-unlimited assortment of shapes, sizes and spectral properties. It is argued that only the human observer can deal with such complexity. Thus, while increasingly automated and supervised procedures for object detection and recognition and processing are flourishing in a variety of fields (e.g. medical imaging, facial recognition, cartography, navigation, surveillance; Szeliski 2011), their application to archaeological and, more generally, cultural landscapes is still in its infancy. However, as a number of published works (see References and General Reading List) and ongoing research demonstrate there are major benefits in developing this broad agenda. This paper provides a general review of the issues from a synergistic rather than competitive perspective, highlighting opportunities and discussing challenges. It also summarises a session on Computer vision vs human perception in remote sensing image analysis: time to move on held at the 44th Computer Applications and Quantitative Methods in Archaeology Conference (CAA 2016 Oslo 'Exploring Oceans of Data') that had a similar objective."

Using a series of GIS tools, we conducted a comparative analysis of the density and spatial distribution of sites dating to the Hellenistic period (ca. 350–50 b.c.). We used the legacy settlement data collected by previous large-scale, intensive, site-oriented field surveys to test the validity of two competing rural settlement models of early Roman colonization: the conventional model of neatly organized settlements regularly dispersed across the landscape and the recently proposed theory that colonists adopted a polynuclear settlement strategy. After calculating the extent to which the archaeological datasets conform to the regular or polynuclear model, we conclude that only a very small portion of the colonized areas actually meets traditional expectations regarding the organization of early colonial settlements. Our analyses show that the legacy survey data is more consistent with the polynuclear settlement theory, but the data also reveals some completely unexpected patterns, suggesting that early Roman colonial landscapes were more diverse than previously thought."

It follows previous reviews about the characteristics of the Pleistocene deposits of the easternmost part of Europe. Deposits of different origin, which constitute the regional stratigraphic units, are characterized. Mammalian data form the base for the (bio)stratigraphical subdivision. Fossil mollusca, ostracoda, mammals and pollen are used for the reconstruction of the palaeoenvironmental conditions and the stratigraphical position of the main localities is discussed.The beginning of the early Middle Pleistocene (Minzitarovo time) coincides with a stabilization of the hydrographic network. Palaeontological remains from that period are rare.forests with small admixture of broad-leaved species were spread at the beginning of this interval. Later, the role of forests decreased and the role of herbs and Chenopodiaceae increased. Palynological data indicate that the climate was cool during that time. The landscapes of the Baza time were dominated by herbaceous-associations and small birch forests with an admixture of broadleaved and coniferous trees and the terminal time was characterized by the wide development of taiga. Ostracods and molluscs are known from those deposits. Ecological composition of the small mammalian faunas indicates forest-steppe conditions for the southern part of this natural zone. Small mammals of that time belong to the Tiraspol faunal assemblage. The climate was warm and dry. The initial Tanyp time was characterized by the development of herbaceous––Chenopodiaceae steppes and broadleaved birch forests, which were subsequently replaced by a dominance of taiga associations, which tolerate cold climatic conditions. Molluscs are represented by rare terrestrial and freshwater species. The assemblage of freshwater ostracods includes cold-resistant species. In the Atasevo time, broadleaved birch forests and meadow-steppes characterized the landscape. The presence of stenothermic–thermophilic ostracods species indicates warm climatic conditions. Molluscs are represented by terrestrial and numerous freshwater species. The small mammalian fauna is characterized by the smaller percentage ofvoles; it post-dates the Baza fauna. The Atasevo fauna is unique because of the occurrence ofSchmidtgen among the typical early Middle Pleistocene species.At the end of this period during the Chusovskoi timespan, the herbaceous––Chenopodiaceae steppes, which covered spacious open areas, were subsequently replaced by coniferous-birch forests with an admixture of broadleaved trees. Fossil remains are rare. Ostracods represent cold-resistant species indicating that the climate was cold."

I start by exploring how the Dacians and Romanians came to be connected, a process that resulted from a combination of nationalistic zeal on behalf of archaeologists and the nationalist propaganda of the Ceau¸sescu regime during the 1970s and 1980s. I then move to the present-day situation, where I argue that archaeologists have reduced themselves to having a minor role in the public sphere, while discussions about the Dacians are dominated by two main players: pseudoarchaeologists and re-enactors. This state of affairs delegitimizes Romanian archaeology and places self-declared specialists and enthusiasts in the position of experts. Some of the Dacian narratives produced in this environment are infused with strong nationalist messages and have the potential to fuel extreme right-wing and even xenophobic movements. Consequently, in the final part of the paper, I recommend that Romanian archaeologists should challenge the representations and interpretations of pseudoarchaeologists and re-enactors. Moreover, academics should make it a priority to re-engage with the public and disseminate their work to a broad audience in a convincing manner."

Previous field and laboratory testing of adhesives has shown the complexities involved in creating an effective Middle Stone Age glue using Acacia gum. However, it is currently unclear how efficient different adhesive recipes are, how much specific ingredients influence their performance, and how difficult it may have been for those ingredients to be combined to maximum effect. We conducted a series of laboratory-based lap shear and impact tests, following modern adhesion testing standards, to determine the efficacy of compound adhesives, with particular regard to the ingredient ratios. We tested rosin (colophony) and gum adhesives, containing additives of beeswax and ochre in varying ratios. During both lap shear and impact tests compound rosin adhesives performed better than single component rosin adhesives, and pure acacia gum was the strongest. The large difference in performance between each base adhesive and the significant changes in performance that occur due to relatively small changes in ingredient ratios lend further support to the notion that high levels of skill and knowledge were required to consistently produce the most effective adhesives."

The isotope data were interpreted in the context of regional food webs, intra-population dietary variation was assessed relative to individual demographic variables and the results were compared to contemporaneous populations at multiple scales. Moderately enriched δ13Cco and elevated δ15N point to substantial contributions from both non-marine and marine protein sources, including nitrogen-enriched pelagic resources. The lack of correlations between δ13Cco and δ13Cap (or δ13Cen) suggests distinct isotopic differences between protein and energy sources. The smaller range and variance of δ13Cco and δ15N values relative to δ13Capand ∆13Cap-co indicate greater inter-individual heterogeneity in dietary energy sources relative to protein sources. Intra-population dietary variation was not, however, correlated with either age or sex, consistent with communal-based food consumption practices. From a broader perspective, the collagen isotope results are comparable with several islands in the Lesser Antilles but are distinct from others, indicating a large degree of regional variation in dietary protein sources, while the bone (and enamel) apatite results are more variable and overlap with many islands in both the Greater and Lesser Antilles indicating wider variation in average (whole) diets. The relative enrichment in δ13Cap and higher ∆13Cap-co values are strongly indicative that C4 (e.g., maize) or CAM plants were important dietary components. Overall, the isotopic evidence suggests that the Lavoutte population consumed mixed diets including substantial contributions of both C3 and C4/CAM plant resources, as well as terrestrial and marine protein sources."

The sessions are: The scientific value of 3D archaeology, organised by Hans Kamermans, Chiara Piccoli and Roberto Scopigno, and Detecting the Landscape(s) – Remote Sensing Techniques from Research to Heritage Management, organised by Axel Posluschny and Wieke de Neef. The common thread amongst the papers presented here is the application of digital recording techniques to enhance the documentation and analysis of the spatial component intrinsically present in archaeological data. For a long time the capturing of the third dimension, the depth, the height or z-coordinate, was problematic. Traditionally, excavation plans and sections were documented in two dimensions. Objects were also recorded in two dimensions, often from different angles. Remote sensing images like aerial photographs were represented as flat surfaces. Although depth could be visualized with techniques such as stereoscopes, analysis of relief was troublesome. All this changed at the end of the last century with the introduction of computer based digitization technologies, 3D software, and digital near-surface sampling devices. The spatial properties of the multi-scale archaeological dataset can now be accurately recorded, analysed and presented. Relationships between artefacts can be clarified by visualizing the records in a three dimensional space, computer-based simulations can be made to test hypotheses on the past use of space, remote sensing techniques help in detecting previously hidden features of landscapes, thus shedding light on bygone land uses."

It is argued that nationalist agendas have played a significant role in the development of Late Iron Age scholarly work since the beginnings of the discipline in the 19th century and particularly after the start of the 20th century. This phenomenon took extreme forms during Nicolae Ceauşescu’ national-communist regime and continues today, albeit, with reduced intensity. For illustrative purposes, four main ideas are discussed in connection to Late Iron Age Romanian archaeology: the assumed unity of the Late Iron Age inhabitants, referred to as Dacians; the Dacians as ancestors of modern Romanians; the issue of ethnic labelling in Late Iron Age archaeology; and finally the implicit superiority of the Dacians. Although the relationship between nationalism and archaeology should not be condemned intrinsically, in the case of Romania such a link is problematic because of three factors: the belief in the scientific character of the discipline; the lack of theoretical discussions on ethnicity; and the archaeologists’ denial of political responsibility for their research. This strategy has led most Late Iron Age scholars to retreat to the “ivory tower” of positivist research, allowing for a large number of non-academic publications about the Dacians to flood the internet and bookshops."

These curating facilities deal with various challenges regarding the care for human remains, but in many cases a lack of sufficient resources affects the conservation of the human remains that have been under long-term curation. This chapter discusses some of the ways in which storage conditions and documentation of human skeletal remains in the region may cost-effectively be improved. Legislation and guidelines pertaining to the treatment of archaeological human remains in other parts of the world provide a potential framework for the development of conservation strategies for human skeletal remains under (long-term) curation in both the Dutch Caribbean, where legislation and guidelines for Dutch archaeology have recently been introduced, and the Caribbean region as a whole. While conservation of human remains is in the interest of all stakeholders, this chapter emphasizes the strengthening of ties between visiting researchers and curators in order to effectively make use of the available expertise and maintain conservation with very few resources. A model for the post-recovery treatment of archaeological human remains based on museum guidelines recently developed in Europe and shared responsibility between visiting researchers and curators is proposed."

This article attempts to rectify this through an in-depth study of an assemblage of nearly 200 iron slags found at the Late Iron Age settlement of Oss-Schalkskamp, just south of the river Meuse. The study aims to determine the nature of the iron activity that took place at this site, placing the results in a micro-regional and macro-regional context. The investigation of the find context shows that the slags were discovered in and around a hearth that had been used for iron forging. The results of this site and nearby settlements point to the existence of small-scale domestic iron production in places difficult to find, probably at the fringe of settlements."

We approach the issue of noncorrespondence between environment and landscape knowledge using fuzzy logic. The numerical data describing two geomorphometric parameters, slope and modified topographic index, are split each into three classes with overlapping borders. The classes are then fused into four qualitative categories: flat wet, steep dry, flat dry, and gradual moist. These four categories have direct correspondence in the real world and can be observed by people through simple perception. The correspondence of such categories to peoples’ perception is checked against evidence of past human settlement in three areas coming from Turkey, Serbia, and Syria. The identified qualitative categories resemble the way people categorized their landscape in all but the second case study. Humans were able to perceive and choose areas which correspond to gradual moist in Turkey and broadly to flat"

Our analyses found no such effect: there are neither positive nor negative correlations between relative brain size and either geographical range size or the average and range of values for environmental seasonality, whether analysed at the level of all primates, or within parvorders (strepsirrhine, catarrhine, platyrrhine). Independent analyses by other researchers comparing feeding behaviour and ecology at individual primate study sites demonstrate that in seasonal environments, the year-round metabolic costs of maintaining a relatively large brain are met by adaptive behavioural/dietary strategies. However, consistent with our own results, those comparative studies found that there was no overall association, whether positive or negative, between ‘raw' environmental seasonality and primate relative brain size. We must therefore look elsewhere for a comparative model of hominin geographical range dynamics in the Pleistocene."

Taxila was a cultural crossroad between East and West and is especially famous for its Greco-Buddhist artefacts. These objects have traditionally been categorised in ethnic and/or cultural terms, which has led to incorrect interpretations of the archaeological record and its historical implications. For this reason, this study works towards a more comprehensive insight into the available archaeological data by means of new object analyses with the aim to contribute to a better understanding of how cultural diversity developed in the ancient world on a global scale through processes of cultural contact and interaction."

Not only did the alteration in living conditions affect disease prevalence, diet and activity patterns were most likely also subjected to change as a result of the developments. Although general trends are noted in historical sources, the impact on the physical body of the villagers and townsmen is difficult to study on the basis of written sources alone. Therefore, to gain greater insights into the consequences of the socioeconomic developments in Medieval Holland and Zeeland, three skeletal assemblages (362 individuals) are compared: early rural Blokhuizen (AD1000-1196), late rural Klaaskinderkerke (AD1200-1573), and urban Alkmaar (AD1448-1572). Specifically, differences in disease prevalence, activity markers, and variation in levels of dental disease and nutritional stress between the collections are studied. Results indicate that infectious disease levels increased for the urban individuals, most likely as a result of higher population densities and poorer hygiene. The higher prevalence of dental caries in the urban individuals suggests an increase in the ingestion of carbohydrate rich food products. The skeletal data on activity indicates that the urban residents were less mobile than their rural counterparts, but were experiencing similar degrees of mechanical loading on their joints. Interestingly, the absence of differences in nutritional deficiencies and other non-specific stress markers suggest that living in the urban centre is not the health hazard it is commonly assumed to be. This poster demonstrates how the skeletal data can be used to gain a better understanding of life in medieval society"

The exploitation of terrestrial small nocturnal browsers may be an indication for the use of complex foraging strategies such as trapping or net-hunting. Hence we analyse the terrestrial fauna of the sites in terms of represented size classes, dietary preference and activity patterns. Seasonally planned coastal visits are also considered ‘modern’ and may be recognised by the presence of large numbers of adult male seals and by shellfish only accessible at low tide. We therefore analyse the representation of marine mammals and the represented molluscs in terms of their habitat preference. Our study suggests that trapping and net-hunting were practised in Marine Isotope Stage 5. In addition, coastal visits were probably planned."

Here, we present a systematic global inventory of extant burning practices-including the reasons for burning and the environmental setting of firing activities-and also discuss their visibility in the archaeological record. This inventory is based on ethnographic and historical texts. In historical times, off-site fire was used for a wide range of purposes, irrespective of age and gender, with significant advantages for its producers. While the reasons given for burning can vary between individuals, in the longer term, many hunter-gatherer firing practices created more mosaic types of environments than would have occurred naturally. The historical visibility of hunter-gatherer burning activities contrasts with the relative invisibility of such practices in the contemporary archaeological record, highlighting the difficulty of analyzing past use of fire. On the basis of its ethnographic importance, we suggest that diverse off-site fire use is as old as the regular use of fire. New multiproxy data from well-sampled sequences, analyzed at a local scale, is needed to test this hypothesis."

At the Malpaís of Zacapu, we use Postclassic ceramics to assess the possible arrival of a group of migrants in the thirteenth century. We aim to understand whether there is technological continuity between the Palacio (AD 900‑1200) and the Milpillas (AD 1200‑1450) phases. This study focuses on one aspect of the operating sequence: the decoration. The technological analysis discussed here highlights differences in the ceramic production between these two phases.

The continuation of this same spectrum into the subsequent Neolithic is of help in the interpretation of, in particular, human remains found scattered across sites.

Argos, Athens and, perhaps, Larissa are also suspected to have manufactured this pottery type. Although Champlevé Ware circulated mainly within the Aegean Sea, its distribution had a much larger range. Vessels were exported to Anatolia, the Black Sea, the Levant and the western Mediterranean. The maritime-based distribution reached mostly urban trading centres along the coast. This preliminary study suggests a diverse and specialised production as well as a dynamic and widespread commercialisation."

The results from the chronological models at both sites suggest that the creation of a burial mound was just one event within a much longer funerary history. For both sites, there are indications that the deceased were buried in flat graves decades and sometimes more than a century prior to any monument construction. Once in place, the barrows were then used as a repository for the dead for decades afterwards. At the same time, a comparison of the models suggests that funerary events at both sites were punctuated. At one site, several barrows were in use simultaneously, at the other, barrows seem to be each other’s successor. The models provide evidence for both protracted histories as well as punctuated events."

We address this problem by introducing a new rectangularity feature that quantifies the degree of alignment of an optimal subset of extracted linear segments with a contour of rectangular shape. The rectangularity feature has high values not only for perfect enclosures, but also for broken ones with distorted angles, fragmented walls, or even a completely missing wall. However, it has zero value for spurious structures with less than three sides of a perceivable rectangle. Performance analysis using large imagery of an alpine environment is provided.

The contemporary primary sources are analysed, specifically the Gothic War by the Byzantine historian Procopius, and the chancellery documents of Cassiodorus’ Variae. By acknowledging the fluidity, situationality and multiple-layered character of identity, it is possible to do justice to the ancient sources and find a middle-way in the modern debate."

Well-dated and well-preserved fossils older than ∼45,000 years that can be unequivocally attributed to Homo sapiens are lacking. Here we present evidence from the newly excavated Fuyan Cave in Daoxian (southern China). This site has provided 47 human teeth dated to more than 80,000 years old, and with an inferred maximum age of 120,000 years. The morphological and metric assessment of this sample supports its unequivocal assignment to H. sapiens. The Daoxian sample is more derived than any other anatomically modern humans, resembling middle-to-late Late Pleistocene specimens and even contemporary humans. Our study shows that fully modern morphologies were present in southern China 30,000-70,000 years earlier than in the Levant and Europe. Our data fill a chronological and geographical gap that is relevant for understanding when H. sapiens first appeared in southern Asia. The Daoxian teeth also support the hypothesis that during the same period, southern China was inhabited by more derived populations than central and northern China. This evidence is important for the study of dispersal routes of modern humans. Finally, our results are relevant to exploring the reasons for the relatively late entry of H. sapiens into Europe. Some studies have investigated how the competition with H. sapiens may have caused Neanderthals' extinction (see ref. 8 and references therein). Notably, although fully modern humans were already present in southern China at least as early as ∼80,000 years ago, there is no evidence that they entered Europe before ∼45,000 years ago. This could indicate that H. neanderthalensis was indeed an additional ecological barrier for modern humans, who could only enter Europe when the demise of Neanderthals had already started."

Movies and other media can be seen in this context as a form of discourse. For Indigenous filmmakers both approaches to ‘Voice’ and having a ‘Voice’ are important. This study explores the way in which Indigenous filmmakers, particularly from Latin America, express their 'Voice' both politically and aesthetically in their films."

We do know that they were present in these environments, but the number of known sites and the size of their assemblages is relatively limited. The Eemian deposits of Neumark-Nord 2 (eastern Germany) yielded the unique opportunity for a detailed analysis of Neandertal behaviour within its environmental context. The reconstructed environmental conditions give us a better understanding of the challenges and opportunities that Neandertals faced, and, together with data from other Eemian sites, provided indications for their environmental preferences. How Neandertals dealt with these environmental conditions is also reflected in the archaeological record, which has been addressed by a detailed analysis of the flint tool assemblage as well as the proxies for hominin use of fire at the site."

The conditions for the preservation of archaeological material however vary between basin types (large, river-fed or small, closed basins), while conditions also differ within a particular basin environment. The goal of this paper is to understand how the dynamics of a small postglacial basin such as Neumark-Nord 2, a context that dominates the Eemian archaeological record, affected the archaeology situated at its basin margin. The approach used here is to correlate the archaeological record with reconstructions of patterns of deposition and the water conditions within the basin, using lithology, micromorphology, pollen, and macroremains from a transect running from the basin center to the margin. The results show that (1) find levels were exposed to overland flow-induced winnowing, which vertically concentrated finds but did not cause significant transport, (2) find levels correspond to phases of increased water presence in the basin, and (3) lateral shifts in hominin activity areas may reflect adjustments in the water level. The research shows the importance of large-scale archaeological excavations and a multidisciplinary sampling strategy that covers both the basin center and the margins, when studying postglacial basin localities like Neumark-Nord 2."

In the present study, we conduct a holistic approach using different techniques (polarized microscopy, Raman spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction) to examine the histomorphological and histochemical variations in the cortical bone of sheep specimens from intrauterine to adult stages, using environmentally controlled specimens from the same species. Our results suggest that during sheep bone development, the most important morphological (shape and size) and chemical transformations in the cortical bone occur during the first weeks of life; synchronized but dissimilar variations are established in the forelimb and hind limb cortical bone; and the patterns of bone tissue maturation in both extremities are differentiated in the adult stage. All of these results indicate that standardized histological models are useful not only for evaluating many aspects of normal bone growth but also to understand other important influences on the bones, such as pathologies that remain unknown.

Does this mean that Neandertals were living in closed forest environments? Due to the potential variability of Eemian environments in space and time, it is necessary to study environmental records that can be correlated with phases of hominin presence, as reflected in the archaeological record. Such a perspective can be obtained from the small basin locality Neumark-Nord 2, as it contains an extensive and detailed environmental record, as well as a large archaeological record consisting of several distinct find levels. Analysis shows that hominin presence is predominantly associated with semi-open environmental conditions. A review of the data from the neighbouring Neumark-Nord 1 basin shows that semi-open environments were also characterizing the wider environment during phases of hominin presence at both basin localities. Large herbivores attracted to the water in these basins may have played an important role in the vegetation openness, probably in conjunction with (local) climatic conditions. The relationship between hominin presence and semi-open environments is explained as Neandertals exploiting the large herbivores aggregating around these freshwater localities, while the more varied vegetation would also have provided them with edible plant foods. Other Eemian sites from freshwater contexts provide evidence for semi-open conditions as well."

Genotyping showed the strain belonged to the 3I lineage, but the Great Chesterford isolate appeared to be ancestral to 3I strains found in later medieval cases in southern Britain and also continental Europe. While a number of contemporaneous cases exist, at present, this case of leprosy is the earliest radiocarbon dated case in Britain confirmed by both aDNA and lipid biomarkers. Importantly, Strontium and Oxygen isotope analysis suggest that the individual is likely to have originated from outside Britain. This potentially sheds light on the origins of the strain in Britain and its subsequent spread to other parts of the world, including the Americas where the 3I lineage of.is still found in some southern states of America."

Miguel John Versluys. The general aim of this project is devoted to the understanding of the different contexts in which Egypt as style, imagery, object, and text, was integrated in the Roman world. It thereby wishes to give Egypt its proper place within the process of Roman cultural innovation through carefully studying its material and textual remains in the context in which they were created and appropriated. Studies on the Roman perception of Egypt, concerning both textual and archaeological sources, generally approach Egypt from fixated and normative concepts. For example, Aegyptiaca have traditionally been interpreted within a framework of oriental cults or Egyptomania. The research project, in contrast, demonstrates that the dichotomy Rome versus Egypt should be approached with care. Besides the present thesis, three other PhD-dissertations are written within the scope of the project: Marike van Aerde, examining the role of Egyptian material culture in Augustan Rome, Sander M_skens, focusing on the material analysis of stone Aegyptiaca in Rome, and Maaike Leemreize, studying the Roman literary perceptions of Egypt. The purpose of this particular dissertation is to obtain a better image of the use, perception, and integration of Egyptian artefacts in domestic contexts, using Pompeii (1st century BC __ 1st century AD) as a case study. The houses of Pompeii yielded many objects that scholars nowadays would call Egyptian or Egyptianised artefacts and are subsumed under the denominator of Aegyptiaca. For the case of Pompeii, Aegyptiaca form a heterogeneous group of both imported and locally produced objects spread throughout the town, consisting of statuettes, imported sculptures, furniture, jewellery, or wall paintings. The most predominant interpretations drawn about the use of these objects have mainly been done on the basis of two accounts: they were interpreted as religious artefacts and explained in the context of the cults of Isis, or they were interpreted as exoticum. The interpretations have been drawn mostly without any contextual analysis or any theoretical underpinnings, and more problematic: the collecting and interpretation of artefacts have been based on modern scholarly perceptions of what Egypt entails, while we as scholars recognise something __Egyptian__ on different grounds than the people of Pompeii once did. The category Aegyptiaca in itself should be seriously questioned and the way Romans categorised should be scrutinised. The aim of this thesis therefore is to analyse the perception of these objects from a bottom up perspective, avoiding the a priori cultural labelling of Egyptian artefacts, but starting instead from the object itself with its main goal to contextualise and to give the finds meaning from within their original use-contexts. For this, methods derived from recent developments in object agency and relationality are used."

In extreme environments such as the high Alpine main ridge and adjacent areas, highly adaptive subsistence strategies were required to exploit natural resources available in the subalpine and alpine zones. Such strategies were determined by changing environmental, social, and economic conditions. To investigate the relationships between settlement dynamics, human impact, and Holocene climatic changes, we studied the valleys of the Silvretta Massif in the central Eastern Alps between the Paznaun(Austria) and Lower Engadine valleys (Switzerland). We are presenting new archaeological, palaeoecological, and pedological evidence of continuous human activities from the Early Neolithic Period to the Bronze Age (~ 5,500–800 BC). This evidence sheds new light on the beginnings of intensified human impact on the high mountainous landscape, i.e. activities beyond Mesolithic hunting along the timberline. Archaeological data suggest a shift in subsistence strategies from hunting to herding at the end of the Neolithic Period (~ 2,800–2,500 BC). While palaeoecological data confirm this trend, they also indicate potentially earlier human and livestock impact through forest clearances by fire and grazing from about 4,200 BC onwards. In addition to archaeological sites and peat bogs, soils in high-altitude regions prove to be appropriate archives indicating former vegetation cover, shifts of timberline altitudes as well as disturbance of soil formation by human activity such as by slash-and-burn and by livestock grazing."

This period was a crucial turning point for the urban landscape of Rome, which was characterised by cultural diversity. Previous studies focus primarily on Greek influences on the development of Augustan material culture, while Egypt remains neglected or simply categorised as exoticism or Egyptomania. This research, in contrast, set out to investigate whether or not __Egypt__ constituted an integral part of Augustan material culture during this period. By comprising for the first time a comprehensive and interpretative overview of manifestations of Egypt in Augustan Rome __including public monuments, paintings, and architectural elements as well as pottery, gems, and jewellery from private contexts__ a wide variety of case studies could be conducted, among which object reappraisals as well as new finds and contextual analyses were featured. By focusing on the archaeological data, this study demonstrates that Egypt was not an exotic Outsider in Rome, but constituted a remarkably diverse part of Roman material culture and the Augustan urban landscape, and was integrally part of the inherently flexible Augustan material culture repertoire."

In this article, formal social network analytical (SNA) methods are applied to archaeological data from the late pre-Hispanic North American Southwest to look at what kinds of social networks characterized those regions that were the most enduring versus those that were depopulated over a 250-year period (A.D. 1200–1450). In that time, large areas of the Southwest were no longer used for residential purposes, some of which corresponds with well-documented region-wide drought. Past research has demonstrated that some population levels could have been maintained in these regions, yet regional scale depopulation occurred. We look at the degree to which the network level property of embeddedness, along with population size, can help to explain why some regions were depopulated and others were not. SNA can help archaeologists examine why emigration occurred in some areas following an environmental crisis while other areas continued to be inhabited and even received migrants. Moreover, we modify SNA techniques to take full advantage of the time depth and spatial and demographic variability of our archaeological data set. The results of this study should be of interest to those who seek to understand human responses to past, present, and future worldwide catastrophes since it is now widely recognized that responses to major human disasters, such as hurricanes, were “likely to be shaped by pre-existing or new social networks” (as reported by Suter et al.

Mapped in detail in the 1990s by means of aerial photographs and ground surveys, more recently ground-penetrating radar (GPR) and high-resolution satellite synthetic aperture radar (SAR) were applied to further interpret this complex archaeological landscape. In combination with remote sensing imagery, the two radiofrequency-based imaging techniques were used to complement the existing archaeological maps. The area housed an extensive low-density urban complex of earthen mounds and ponds, approximately 5 × 5 km square and centring on the Bakong, an early Angkorian state temple, crossed and encircled by a mostly disconnected water-management network of embankments and canals. Extensive GPR surveys, conducted predominantly on the existing small roads and paths criss-crossing the landscape, appraise the visible archaeological features with subsurface information. The analysis verifies the existence of channels and embankments, complementing the information with depth and width. The identification of additional, now desiccated, canals and river channels assisted in connecting a number of already mapped archaeological features, and helped to distinguish possible later additions, thereby untangling the water-management network. Spotlight TerrSAR-X satellite data together with satellite images of the visual spectrum complemented the analysis, by providing information about water saturation in areas inaccessible to ground surveys, marking out palaeochannels and providing clues about the landscape before development took place. This three-dimensional interpretation informs on the functioning of this particular early Angkorian hydraulic system, adding to the understanding of water management in medieval Southeast Asia."

Their distinct fossil remains have been retrieved from Portugal in the west to the Altai area in central Asia in the east and from below the waters of the North Sea in the north to a series of caves in Israel in the south. Having thrived in Eurasia for more than 300,000 years, Neandertals vanished from the record around 40,000 years ago, when modern humans entered Europe. Modern humans are usually seen as superior in a wide range of domains, including weaponry and subsistence strategies, which would have led to the demise of Neandertals. This systematic review of the archaeological records of Neandertals and their modern human contemporaries finds no support for such interpretations, as the Neandertal archaeological record is not different enough to explain the demise in terms of inferiority in archaeologically visible domains. Instead, current genetic data suggest that complex processes of interbreeding and assimilation may have been responsible for the disappearance of the specific Neandertal morphology from the fossil record."

This is evident in the selection of agricultural tools for deposition. Agriculture was of course an important collective task. There are also indications that flint knapping took place around the tomb. A third observation concerns the enigmatic scratches on the transverse arrowheads and flakes, forming regular patterns that cannot have a post-depositional origin. Lastly, both the axes and the amber beads ended up in the grave in a used state, indicating a previous life. However, prior to deposition both items were reground, obliterating any traces of individual ownership before they could be deposited in the communal burial ground."

This interglacial stage is the last and best documented interglacial stage in which Neandertals were present in Europe. This study aims to contribute to the debate on Neandertal environmental tolerances of this period in Europe by improving our knowledge of the timing of Neandertal occupation. In order to further specify the timing and character of this occupation, detailed palaeomagnetic and environmental studies were carried out at the interglacial sites of Neumark Nord 2 (Germany), Rutten (The Netherlands), and Caours (France). For the Last Interglacial, a global stratigraphic marker has been documented, the so-called Blake Event. This palaeomagnetic event is recorded in both marine and terrestrial sediments and has been found in settings which allow direct correlation with the Marine Isotope Stage record. Our palaeomagnetic studies at Neumark Nord 2, Rutten and Caours have provided a strong indication for the presence of a palaeomagnetic event which we have identified as the Blake. We were able to correlate this Blake Event to the pollenzones of the Eemian sensu stricto at Rutten and at Neumark Nord 2. The observed position of the Blake Event in relation to the Eemian in north western and central Europe supports a time lag of 5000 years between the onset of the Eemian in the south and the northern-central parts of Europe. This result has consequences for views of the chronological and geographical limits of the Neanderthal range. As an example, our correlation indicates that both Neumark Nord 2 and Caours were occupied well after the MIS 5e global high sea level stand. This implies that during these occupations, easy access to the British Isles was blocked by the fully developed English Channel, possibly explaining the absence of hominins in what is now Great Britain at that period"

Forty years ago large-scale excavations were carried out in the region and extensive settlement areas were investigated. None of these excavations are fully published, but nevertheless a model for Bronze Age habitation of West Frisia was presented in the 1970s. In 2007, 2009 and 2011 a total area of 6 ha to the northwest of the town of Enkhuizen was excavated. The results of these excavations present us with an opportunity to evaluate some current ideas about the wide distribution and development of the settlements, the house building traditions and economic aspects of Bronze Age farmers in West Frisia. At least a few centuries before the estuary at Bergen closed, Bronze Age habitation appeared, both on sanded up creek ridges and on the low-lying clay areas adjacent to, and between the creek ridges. The extent of habitation appears to be on a much wider scale than was previously suggested. House plans are remarkably similar, but there is substantially less repairing and rebuilding than previously thought. Also, there are new considerations about the generality of changes in subsistence strategy, the presumed landscape openness and the way the habitation came to an end just before the start of the Iron Age. If it is not a higher groundwater level that caused the inhabitants to build the 'terps' in the second half of the Late Bronze Age, it may well have been inundations, though not necessarily of a marine origin."

Archaeological studies have demonstrated that the trajectories of Neolithisation in Northwest Europe were diverse. This book presents a study into the archaeology of the indigenous communities involved in the process of Neolithisation in the Lower Rhine Area (5500-2500 cal BC). It elucidates the role played by these in relation to their environmental context. This work brings together a comprehensive array of excavated archaeological sites in the Lower Rhine Area and indicates that the successive Late Mesolithic, Swifterbant culture, Hazendonk group and Vlaardingen culture societies represent a continuous long-term tradition of inhabitation of the wetlands and their margins. After demonstrating the existence of a diverse Mesolithic background to Neolithisation, the subsequent developments are studied by foregrounding the relationship between local communities and the dynamic wetland landscape. This points to long-term flexible behaviour and pragmatic choices in livelihood, food economy and mobility. For the interpretation of Neolithisation this study emphasises the persistent traditions of the communities involved. New elements are shown to be attuned to existing hunter-gatherer practices. By documenting indications of the mentalité of the wetland inhabitants, it is demonstrated that their mindset remains essentially ‘Mesolithic' for millennia."

Across Europe, barrows still figure as a prominent element in the landscape. Many barrows in Europe have been excavated, revealing much about what was buried inside these monuments. Little is known, however, about the landscape in which the barrows were situated and what role barrows played in this landscape. Palynological data, carrying important clues on the barrow environment, are absent for most of the excavated barrows in Europe. In the Netherlands however, palynological data are available for hundreds of excavated barrows. However, while local vegetation reconstructions from these barrows are available, a reconstruction of the total landscape around the barrows has yet to made, without which it would be difficult to understand their role in the prehistoric cultural landscape.In this thesis a detailed vegetation history around barrows is reconstructed. Newly obtained and extant data derived from palynological analyses taken from barrow sites have been (re-)analysed. Methods in barrow palynology have been discussed and further developed when necessary and newly developed techniques have been applied in order to get a better impression of what role barrows played in their environment.Barrows were built on ancestral heaths, which were maintained for many generations by heath communities. The barrow landscape was included in the economic zone of farming communities in the area, while the heath areas were used as grazing grounds. The ancestral heaths were very stable elements in the landscape and were kept in existence for thousands of years. In fact, it is argued that these ancestral heaths were the most important factor in structuring the barrow landscape."

Roman cameo glass constitutes an interesting and so far underexplored example of this process. By examining two case studies of cameo glass with Egyptian decorative elements from the collection of The British Museum, this paper explores how Egyptian elements were incorporated in and became an integral part of the material culture of Augustan Rome. The first case study looks at one specific cameo glass fragment; here Egypt is evoked through the fusion of Egyptian stylistic and thematic elements with Greek stylistic components and Roman materials, and seems intended to convey a certain concept of Egypt that could be recognised as such within its Roman context. The second case study explores how the arrival of an obelisk from Egypt in Rome initiated the proliferation of different visual concepts of that Egyptian monument throughout the material culture of Augustan Rome, varying from actual copies of the monolith to its portrayal as part of the Circus Maximus on gemstones and cameo glass vessels of Roman manufacture."

Nevertheless, its central presence in textbooks belies a lack of understanding in both disciplines of the complex history of the region. The research presented here reassesses the interactions that occurred among the multiform indigenous communities (Meillacoid and Chicoid) that inhabited the region during the pre-Columbian period. A focus on these interactions forms the basis of an approach that can differentiate this region from others on Hispaniola and the Western Caribbean. It also links this research to recent Pan-Caribbean approaches, such as those employed by the Caribbean Research Group at the University of Leiden. As a result this research attempts to go beyond the traditional diachronic studies used in indigenous archaeology and rather will take a synchronic perspective. This highlights such issues as inter-group communication, competency, transculturation and syncretism that emerge from the Caribbean pre-Columbian multicultural mosaic. All of this is derived from an in-depth study of the cultural landscape in northern Hispaniola and nuances in material culture expressions, especially ceramic formal and stylistic traditions."

We do not observe differences between the pioneer sites and the older occupation sites. Furthermore, no significant differences were observed between the OIS from one village to another.  A comparison of geological samples from Belgium and Germany allowed to link archaeological samples to Lower Famennian OIS of the southern border of the Namur Synclinorium.  The latter spots are most probably located between the towns of Loyable and Amay, along the Meuse river valley. We may therefore conclude that the early Neolithic people looked at the same spots (in a geographic area of about three kilometers along the Meuse river axis).  Moreover, they have selected their primary raw materials using the richness in iron ooids and the scarcity in quartz and calcite as main selection criteria. This study is still in progress, now taking into account other types of (non-oolitic) red rocks from LBK sites in the Hesbaye area, The Netherlands and Lorraine, in order to trace the geographical and geological provenances of the raw materials. So far, we can already suggest that the sources are local to regional for the red sandstones and of German origin for the non-oolitic hematitic ores."

In some regions dense concentrations of monuments form peculiar configurations such as long alignments while in others they are spread out extensively, dotting vast areas with hundreds of mounds. These vast barrow landscapes came about through thousands of years of additions by several successive prehistoric and historic communities. Yet little is known about how these landscapes developed and originated. That is what this research set out to do. By unravelling the histories of specific barrow landscapes in the Low Countries, several distinct activity phases of intense barrow construction could be recognised. Each of these phases contributed to how the barrow landscape developed and reveals shifting attitudes to these monuments. By creating new monuments in a specific place and in a particular fashion, prehistoric communities purposefully transformed the form and shape of the barrow landscape. Using several GIS-techniques such as a skyline-analysis, this research is able to demonstrate how each barrow took up a specific (and different) position within such a social landscape. While the majority of the barrows were only visible from relatively close by, specific monuments took up a dominating position, cresting the horizon, being visible from much further away. It is argued in this research that these burial mounds remained important landscape monuments on the purple heathlands. They continued to attract attention, and by their visibility ensured to endure in the collective memory of the communities shaping themselves around these monuments."

All of the ruined huts, cellars and livestock enclosures at these sites are visible on the surface and show a limited range of shapes and proportions.

These methods are intended to assist archaeological survey in vast and/or difficult to access areas by screening large amounts of remotely sensed images in order to detect possible archaeological sites prior to fieldwork (Cowley, 2012). Our general approach aims at assessing the probability of the presence of objects of our interest based on geometric cues that can be automatically detected in the satellite and aerial images that we use.

It was shown that hide processing predominates. The extent and character of the wear on the hide working implements indi- cates that different processing stages took place, including dehairing and currying. It is suggested that the quality of the end product, the processed hide, must have been very high. Other craft activities are woodworking and the task responsible for ‘polish 23', possibly flax processing. A large number of sickle blades were found as well, displaying a considerable variation in polish attributes. A possible explana- tion is that different crops were harvested with the same sickle. Spatial analysis of the demonstrated acti- vities has suggested that hide processing was concentrated in one area, possibly supporting the hypothe- sis that in addition to a domestic mode of production, a loose mode of production was practiced as well."

It is a period that shows a vast amount of regional differentiation in terms of site types, chronologies, material culture and subsistence patterns, yet it is period for which there are pitifully few comprehensively excavated, analysed and published sites. It is this intriguing period of human history that forms the basis of this research, with the site of Tell Sabi Abyad in the Balikh Valley of the northern Syrian dessert steppe forming the central focus. This impressive site has revealed over 1000 years of seemingly uninterrupted occupation, the excavation of which has unveiled a wealth of finds giving an insight into life some 8000 years ago. One of the most numerous finds is the faunal material; thousands upon thousands of animal bone fragments being all that is left of generations of hunting and farming at and around the site. This book is the result of the research undertaken on this material by Anna Russell for her PhD thesis at Leiden University. The analysis of these remains has given important and new insights into hunting and farming practices over a millennium. The local spectrum of wild and domestic fauna in the area is discussed together with an assessment of the domestication status of some of the key domestic animals through time – sheep, goats, cattle and pigs - with the methods of herding implemented being carefully elucidated from the zooarchaeology data together with an isotopic study of diet. The relationship between the animals and their natural environment and the possible implications of an abrupt climate change (the ‘8.2 k BP Event’ which peaked c. 6200 BC) on the subsistence patterns of the late Neolithic people of Tell Sabi Abyad are also considered in detail. This comprehensive zooarchaeological study of the faunal remains, uncovered during the excavations of Tell Sabi Abyad, has not only shown the gradual development of animal husbandry to the detriment to hunting throughout the seventh millennium BC, but has also revealed for the first time one of the earliest uses of domestic animals for secondary products, such as milk and fibre. It has also uncovered evidence that people adapted to changes in their local environment brought about by climate change through local innovation and promotion of cultural adaptations developed as a result of generations of living in a marginal environment. As such this research brings us one step closer to filling the void in our knowledge of this pivotal period at the end of the Neolithic period."

The aim of the PhD research was to come to an archaeological vision of precolonial domestic life in Hispaniola (Dominican Republic and Haiti), rather than rely on Spanish colonial descriptions from the 15th and 16th centuries. The dissertation presents archaeological research from the site of El Cabo, perched on a coastal promontory at the extreme eastern end of the Dominican Republic, and seven centuries of indigenous community history from its development and florescence, to eventual demise through the dominant structure, the house. Over two thousand archaeological features cut directly into the limestone bedrock, and an artefact assemblage of pottery, shell and stone led to reconstructions of fifty domestic structures, thirty of which are houses, which formed part of a community between ca. AD 800 and 1504. The repeated rebuilding, or renewal of houses led to the development of long-lived estates, referred to as House Trajectories, the most successful of which lasted up to 500 years. These results offer new, deep perspectives on precolonial domestic dynamics."

De pot symboliseert het einde van een lang neolithisatietraject met overwegend zuid-contacten, dat al rond 5000 cal BC is begonnen en gedocumenteerd is door schaarse toevalsvondsten van aardewerk, bijlen en klingartefacten. Hij vertegenwoordigt een periode, waarin de Veluwe tijdelijk binnen een noordelijke culturele invloedssfeer (TRB) komt te liggen. Minstens zo interessant is de interpretatie van de pot als een intentionele pot-depositie, passend in een neolithische traditie die hetzelfde tijdtraject omvat en ook nog in later tijd (potbekers) is te vervolgen."

The aim of this thesis is to research whether it is necessary to combine archaeological and historical data when both are available. The case study consists of an isolated event: the Batavia incident. The Batavia, a ship of the Dutch East India Company, was stranded off the coast of Western Australia in 1629. A small group took the boat and went for help while the rest of the people were left on the islands. While they waited for the rescue ship to arrive, a massacre broke out and over a hundred people were murdered. Information from written sources (e.g. a ship‟s journal and letters) is combined with archaeological evidence. Although many issues were confirmed by both types of sources, sometimes the records were contradictory and a great deal of information was exclusive to one of the types of data. To assemble a complete picture of the Batavia incident, it was essential to consult both historical and archaeological sources.

Interpretations in terms of competence are usually based on the species represented in bone assemblages, such as the presence or absence of large and dangerous species. However, the sophistication of hunting strategies is not the only factor that influences the exploitation of prey species. Before interpreting an assemblage in terms of hunting proficiency, more parsimonious explanations of prey choice must be eliminated. One important reason to focus on certain species is that they are more economic to exploit than others. To test whether the presence or absence of species can be explained by economic motives rather than by hunting proficiency, Optimal Foraging Theory is applied to Pleistocene bone assemblages. The motives that drive prey choice are studied by modelling the behavioural characteristics of species and scrutinizing which characteristics the exploited species had in common. Application to Middle Palaeolithic sites in the Eemian of Germany shows that large and dangerous species were exploited frequently, but that solitary species are better represented at some sites than species living in herds. In another case-study from the Middle Stone Age in South Africa, the most important characteristic of selected prey species is their size. Large and dangerous species were preferred over smaller dangerous species. The better representation of large docile species can be ascribed to “common sense” and not, as has been suggested, to a lack of hunting proficiency."

It focuses on the time bracket 1.0-0.6 Ma, within which Mammuthus meridionalis (the southern mammoth) finally became extinct in Europe. Its descendant,the initially eastern Asian steppe mammoth (M. trogontherii) was a comparatively late immigrant in Europe (c. 1.2-1.0 Ma)and then for a time was the only mammoth species there. European sites that yielded relevant material are rivised. The probability of hybridisation between the said species, suggested by the occurrence of so-called mosaic molars, is discussed. In addition, a number of subspecific taxa traditionally referred to M. meridionalis is now ascribed to M. trogontherii, which reduces the role played by M. meridionalis at the end of the Early Pleistocene."

The study proceeds along the route of a ‘spatial investigation’, offering a fresh look and detailed insights into the past society and the built environment of this port town. Following a scaled approach, the work examines different aspects of Ostia’s urban landscape, applying Space Syntax’s methods for spatial analysis to the urban neighbourhood of one city block – Insula IV ii, selected buildings (Ostia’s guild seats), and the entire street system. All through the study a ‘Space First’ policy has been followed, combining archaeological research with today’s insights into urban planning. The heart of this scalar approach is the complete re-working of the archaeological evidence and its interpretative potential for the city block, Insula IV ii. This neighbourhood enjoys an excellent location and boasts a striking variety of buildings including the well-known Terme del Faro, the Caseggiato dell’Ercole, and the Caupona del Pavone, but till now has not been studied in its entirety and within its own social and spatial context. Through a careful reconstruction of the Insula’s development over the first three centuries AD, the work fills a lacuna – but more importantly it reveals the way everyday life was structured in the city, and how this evolved over time in response to internal and external influences on the lives of its inhabitants. Rethinking Ostia draws upon archaeological data and extensive spatial analyses, both carefully documented and illustrated. The findings highlight the active role of space in structuring social activity in the ancient city."

In response, it was necessary and urgent to establish museums in which to display such remains, aesthetically and historically and to ensure their protection. This was achieved over a fairly short period of time, and museums have the role of displaying and safeguarding the collection in its custody. However, a preliminary check gave the impression that most museums in Jordan do not have the necessary human and material resources to perform this function satisfactorily. In recent years, museum science experienced a strong advancement, in particular when dealing with issues of indoor environment, and models of requirements have been designed. This thesis aims to describe, analyse and discuss the current situation of a number of selected museums in Jordan, with a focus on aspects of indoor environment. It intends to be an inclusive study that would provide recommendations and suggestions, hopefully enabling official senior level museum staff to address these needs, and work to improve them in order to portray a good image of Jordan and its historical legacy. It has been noticed that, at present, some artefacts are suffering deterioration and damage due to uncontrolled environmental conditions and mishandling by untrained staff; if this situation is not addressed promptly it may well lead to the destruction of these valuable and vulnerable objects. For this reason, a study of the processes of deterioration is required, prior to any recommendations concerning conservation treatments. In fact, excavated archaeological objects can be conserved and stabilized by a combination of instruments, whether these objects are on display or kept in storage. Therefore the indoor museum environment should be controlled and the staff properly trained to deal with objects adequately. These are basic necessities to ensure that museums and staff are able to fulfil the role of a modern museum, i.e. to be a sustainable social and educational resource."

The way in which we deal with other peoples views in the interpretation of archaeological materials, the way in which we integrate our narratives and practices with other heritage demands, and the way in which we deal with power differences in both these processes; all are challenging issues when undertaking archaeological research projects abroad. Sjoerd van der Linde brings forward an ethnographic and discursive analysis of two archaeological projects by the Faculty of Archaeology of Leiden University - notably the Deir Alla Joint Archaeological Project in the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan and the Santa Barbara Project in Cura_ao. Focusing on the ways and extents to which these projects are influenced by different policy and funding programs, and investigating the operational systems, social relationships and dominating values and discourses that determine project outcomes, he explores how archaeological research projects abroad work in their social context. Van der Linde offers a critical reflection upon the role and responsibility of archaeologists in relation to the values and demands of other actors in society."

The research adopts a multidisciplinary approach which evaluates numerous lines of archaeological evidence and historical data. The theoretical basis is that domination plays a key role in the structuring of relationships among individuals, cultures and societies. Basic forms of domination are identified in El Chorro de Maíta, a village of indios encomendados: people forced to work for the Spaniards in exchange for religious and “civilizing” instruction. The cemetery, located in the village, reveals an ethnic diversity that includes indigenous people from different regions, mestizos and an African individual. A diversity of identities is also revealed, some constructed through adaptations to colonial life (‘indi ans’), and others through ethnic and cultural mixing. This ethnogenesis, as well as the syncretic peculiarities in some burials, and the very in-between nature of the cemetery itself as a colonial product where indigenous and Christian traditions are conserved and combined, represents a context of emergent sixteenth century transculturation, in which indians are active social agents fighting for their survival."
20136,Britons abroad : the mobility of Britons and the circulation of British-made objects in the Roman Empire,"Ivleva, T.A.                                                         2012",,Doctoral Thesis,open access,"Britons abroad is a contribution to the study of ancient mobility in the Roman Empire with the focus on the mobility of materials and people and the ways objects and people interact dialectically when brought to a new environment. This study looks at Britons who, voluntarily or forcedly, moved overseas in the period of the first to third centuries AD and identifies the ways one can use to trace their mobility. It also explores the changes in the personal and communal identification as expressed by Britons, who settled abroad, and tries to locate a unified element in the (ethnic) identities when compared to those people who stayed put with those who migrated. The exploration of ‘Britishness’ abroad in the Roman Empire is set out on a variety of levels: individual (personal migration from Britain) and communal (the occurrence of British military units abroad); human mobility and mobility of artefacts; movement of British-born and Continental-born to and from Britain. This research approaches the study of mobility and social changes in moved communities through a province-by-province study of archaeological sites and their assemblages but is not limited to the physical borders of the Roman Empire."

Samples of human enamel from 360 individuals from multiple sites spanning a broad range of geographic and temporal contexts were analyzed for strontium isotope composition. These results were interpreted in reference to a database of strontium isotope variation for the Caribbean biosphere created through the analysis of 288 modern and archeological animal and plant samples. These combined strontium isotope datasets contributed to assessments of the spatial patterning of bioavailable strontium isotopes in the region and to estimations of the local range of isotope variation for the different site populations. These ranges were used to determine whether individuals were of local or nonlocal origin and were then analyzed to examine variability in patterns of migration, with a specific focus on testing possible relationships between residential origins and biological sex, age at death, chronology, grave goods, and dietary practices. Carbon and oxygen isotope analyses of dental enamel were also conducted on a subset of 50 individuals to assess their potential for provenance studies in the Caribbean region and for investigating the origins of suspected long-distance migrants."

As a result of technological and methodological progress in archaeology, mobility has become increasingly visible on the level of the individual. However, as a concept it does not seem to fit with current approaches in Amazonian archaeology, which favour a move away from viewing small mobile groups as models for the deeper past. Instead of ignoring such ethnographic tyrannies, in this book they are considered to be essential for arriving at a different past. Viewing archaeological mobility as the sum of movements of both people and objects, the empirical part of Amotopoan Trails focuses on Amotopo, a small contemporary Trio village in the interior of Suriname. The movements of the Amotopoans are tracked and positioned in a century of Trio dynamics, ultimately yielding a recent archaeology of Surinamese-Trio movements for the Sipaliwini River basin (1907-2008). Alongside the construction of this archaeology, novel mobility concepts are introduced. They provide the conceptual footholds which enable the envisioning of mobility at various temporal scales, from a decade up to a century, the sequence of which has remained a blind spot in Caribbean and Amazonian archaeology."

23580,Databases of the people aboard the VOC ships Batavia (1629) & Zeewijk (1727) – An analysis of the potential for finding the Dutch castaways’ human remains in Australia.,"Ariese, C.E.                                                         2012",,Book (monograph),open access,"General Introduction  The reefs surrounding the Houtman Abrolhos in Western Australia were a notorious hazard to shipping in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries (fig. 1). The Dutch East India Company (VOC) made sure to mark this island group on its maps and skippers had strict instructions to avoid coming into contact with these reefs. Even so, the VOC is known to have lost two ships here, Batavia and Zeewijk. Some of the castaways from both of these shipwrecks, although faced by many difficult challenges, managed to reach Batavia, the headquarters of the VOC in the Indies. Their journals and stories have survived in archives. Those who died or were murdered in the Houtman Abrolhos may have left their mark in other ways. Western Australia now possibly possesses a large number of Dutch human remains from the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. This paper is presented in two sections; the first concerns Batavia and the second focuses on Zeewijk. Each of these sections can be read independently.  When Batavia wrecked on Morning Reef on 4 June 1629, its castaways soon spread out over the islands of the Wallabi Group. Depending on how many of the 200 deceased were buried, the islands may have preserved a significant number of human remains from the Batavia castaways. So far, only ten of these have been discovered and tentatively identified. This paper provides an estimate of how many graves may be found, where they could be and who they might belong to. Furthermore, it also lists those people who survived and whose human remains definitely will not be found. Finally, all of this information has been compiled into three databases - of all the murdered individuals (Appendix I), of all who died in Australian territory (Appendix II) and of all named individuals involved in the Batavia tragedy (Appendix III) - excerpts of which are included as appendixes. The information provided for each individual may be useful in identifying the human remains.  In 1727, Zeewijk was wrecked on Half-Moon Reef in the Pelsaert Group. A large number of survivors would eventually build a seagoing vessel and successfully reach Batavia, but many died before the rescue. These castaways have also left their marks in the Houtman Abrolhos with camp sites and burial sites. This part of the project began with the construction of a database of all men who were (meant to be) on board Zeewijk and their fates (Appendix IV). As a result it has been possible to fill a number of gaps and put names to a number of deaths that until now had been anonymous. The paper focuses specifically on assessing how many of the Zeewijk's castaways may have been buried in the Houtman Abrolhos on Gun Island and on identifying these victims. In addition, it provides accurate crew lists for each section of the voyage and establishes a framework for further research into the individuals who lived aboard Zeewijk.  Significant work has already been undertaken into researching both Batavia and Zeewijk: their wreck sites, land sites and the human remains of the castaways. Henrietta Drake-Brockman's Voyage to Disaster provided the first English translation of the journal of the Batavia's journey and her analysis of this journal led to the discovery of the wreck site. The journals have been researched and translated again by Marit van Huystee. Analyses of the victims, including forensic investigations, have been made by Bernadine Hunneybun, Juliette Pasveer, Daniel Franklin, Alistair Paterson, Len Freedman and others. Finally, the staff of the Western Australian Museum has compiled a large number of reports based on their investigations of Batavia and the associated sites over the years. Zeewijk has also been the focus of in depth research by the Western Australian Museum, most notably by Catharina Ingelman-Sundberg. Translations of (segments of) the Zeewijk journals and documents have been made by Willem Timmers, Louis Zuiderbaan and Cornelis de Heer.  Some of these projects have focused on the castaways and victims, creating lists or databases. However, all of these databases and lists were made using translations or transcripts as their sources. As such, errors (often based on the difficulty of reading the original handwriting or because of the lack of a uniform spelling) have crept in which have been taken over from list to list. Additionally, information that was - accidentally - omitted from these translations and transcripts is equally absent from these lists. To avoid falling into the same pitfalls, this work and the databases (which can be found in the appendixes) are based on the original documents. Studying the documents on microfilm or in high resolution photographs, the author was able to find new information, sort out mistakes and fill in a number of gaps."

Technological, morphological, stylistic and archaeological data are integrated into the understanding of pottery production and use. The pottery itself and its chronological sequence, the shaping and firing techniques, raw materials, wasters and unfired pottery are presented. In addition, workshops and their layout, tools, as well as pottery kilns and their construction are discussed. Together with information on standardization, output and demand, as well as information from contemporary texts, these sources are used to reconstruct the organization of pottery production at the site. A chapter on vessel function and use including a list of Middle Assyrian vessel names concludes the study. Introductory chapters discuss field methodology, the historical background and stratigraphical information. Seven appendices present the database used for this study, the shape typology, a detailed study of the pottery kilns, the results of archaeometric research including thin-section analyses, potters’ marks, and cuneiform texts from Sabi Abyad related to pottery. The thesis is lavishly illustrated, including an extensive catalogue, detailed illustrations of workshops, tools, shaping techniques, kilns, thin-section slides, and vessels in iconography"

Through the systematic analysis of source materials and a comparison of these with lithic artefacts, the provenance of a significant portion of stone material found at a number of prehistoric Amerindian habitation sites located on different islands from Puerto Rico to Martinique was determined. Following this the distribution of three specific materials, including a variety of flint from Long Island, Antigua, a grey-green mudstone and a multi-coloured conglomerate, both form St. Martin, were specified. These distribution patterns along with data on the production of the artefacts were used to determine the mode of exchange that was responsible for their spread. From these data it appeared that inter-island exchange was a recurrent feature among Amerindian society in the Caribbean throughout the entire Ceramic Age. Furthermore the differences in distributions through time could be related to changes in socio-political organisation within the region and supported the notion of increasing competition within society."

This resulted in an extended site catalogue and insight in the local occupation history until the arrival of Europeans. The earliest occupational evidence dates from AD 400. People lived in coastal settlements and ate tubers, (shell)fish, land animals, birds, fruits and seeds. The food economy hardly changed hereafter. Long distance contacts, reaching the South-American mainland, existed. After AD 600/850 the number of villages increased and special locations for ceremonial and other activities were established. Many villages were coastal, some were inland. One village assumed a central role. Long distance contacts (reaching the mainland and the Greater Antilles) continued to exist. Intensive short distance contacts first appear. From AD 1200/1300 population decreased, probably as result of developing complex societies on the Greater Antilles. People lived on high elevations. Long distance contacts and local networks continued to exist. After the end of the 15th century, the research area was no longer inhabited by Amerindians."

These settlements are characterised by a spatial organisation in which buildings are grouped in neighbourhood clusters and in which an estimated 30 to 40 households would have lived. These neighbourhoods lack streets, and the buildings within them were accessed from the roof level. The study explores the social significance of this form of organisation of settlement space at a number of levels. First, the nature of the individual buildings and how these related to household is investigated. Second, non-domestic features in these settlements, such as sub-floor burials, are contextualised in order to identify status differentiation between buildings. Third, the scale and composition of clustered neighbourhoods is studied, to arrive at a better understanding of their significance. Finally, the manner in which neighbourhoods in a settlement related to one another and the ways in which settlements were part of larger settlement systems is considered. In this manner new light is shed on the social structure of these Central Anatolian Neolithic communities"

While the focus is on the relatively small Low Countries and their huge overseas territories, the Belgian Congo and the Netherlands East Indies, related developments in three adjacent colonial powers, Germany, France, and the United Kingdom, are also covered, as are links to the United States. This book charts the means and places through which tribal objects circulated and continue to circulate: colonial trading posts, missionary posts, attics and cellars, living rooms, museums, flea markets, monasteries, auction houses, artists' studios, private collections, and art galleries. In the second part of the book dealers, collectors, and curators relate their more recent experiences with objects-in-motion. This chronicle of European taste, trade and desire sketches the emergence of a western market for tribal art in the course of the twentieth century."

First, the physieallandscape is treated as the arena of subsistenee activities, second, the 'symbolie landscape' construeted by societies as the context of their soeial and spiritual lives. It is subsequently discussed how many pitfalls there are not so much in the empirical reeonstruction of the physical environment, but especial/y in the attempts to understand the man-land relationships and their transformations on the very long term: Ethnographic analogy has the danger to degrade prehistory to a clone of subrecent societies and to deprive it of its originality. Ethnocentrism brings modern values in. Ecological determinism reverses the causes and effects. The second part gives an outline of the man-nature relations in the Lower Rhine bas in since the last lee Age as far as empirical data allow. It is the story of the 'domestication' of the landscape. Af ter the small-scale reelamations of the Neolithic the forests were rigorouslv opened up in the first millennium cal. BC by the plough farmers of the Bronze Age. The so-called Celtic field system of the subsequent first millennium can be conceived as a measure to resto re sustainability on the poor upland coversand landscapes. A restricted number of demographic data together with the long term environmental impact registrations of pol/en diagrams allow us to follow the dynamics of environment and society over the last seven or even more millennia."

In archaeology, however, it does not (yet) play an important role. In the past twenty years archaeologists have discussed the potentials of, in particular, expert systems. They have developed some valuable systems, but the general impression is that archaeology is not a suitable host discipline for knowledge-based approaches. In Archaeology and the Application of Artificial Intelligence: case studies on use-wear analysis of prehistoric flint tools, dr.M.H. van den Dries sets out to validate this negative conclusion. She states that since most archaeological applications were mere prototypes and have never been subjected to objective tests, there is hardly any ground for this rather radical inference. In order to ground her conclusion objectively, Van den Dries has built two applications, an expert system and a neural network. She used use-wear analysis of prehistoric tools as the application area. The main objective of the project was to develop a practical training tool for students. As Van den Dries' aim was to demonstrate the practical applicability of both applications, they were exposed to two objective tests in which replicated stone tools as well as prehistoric artefacts were involved. In one test both experience use-wear analysts and students participated. The outcome of this trail has been compared with the results of all other blind tests that human use-wear analysts have carried out hitherto. An important conclusion of Van den Dries' study is that both applications perform well, but that the expert system is better equipped for educational tasks, while the neural network approach mainly suits research purposes. Therefore, the expert system application, called WAVES, has been made operational. It already supports students of several archaeology departments around the world in learning use-wear analysis. Based on her findings Van den en Dries subsequently advises archaeologists to exploit better the merits that artificial intelligence offers them, because it is a means to record unique and valuable expert knowledge, to obtain objective analysis results and to democratize archaeological knowledge."

So we generally have a too romantic and idealized vision of the past. It is demonstrated that environmental impact in the Netherlands was severe from the early Metal Ages onward. The agricultural system on the uplands was not sustainable, not in 'harmony with nature', but destructive. Less than 30 000 people did away with major parts of the 'virgin forests' in two millennia. Certainly, prehistory was unpolluted, but it was less varied and shows a distinct human impact in its vegetation than realized when 'prehistory' is chosen as a reference for nature management and development.
